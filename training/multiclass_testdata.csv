241637,"Seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, pCO(2), and O-2 in the eastern subarctic Pacific (ocean weather station Papa)","A coupled, one-dimensional ecosystem/carbon flux model is used to simulate the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, O-2, and pCO(2) at ocean weather station Papa (OWS P at 50degreesN, 145degreesW). The 23-year interannual simulation (1958-1980) is validated with available data and analyzed to extend seasonal and interannual variations beyond the limited observational records. The seasonal cycles of pCO(2) and sea-air CO2 flux are controlled by a combination of thermodynamics, winds, and biological uptake. There is ingassing of CO2 during the fall-winter months when SSTs are colder and wind forcing is vigorous, while there is a much smaller ingassing of CO2 during the summer when sea surface temperatures are warmer and wind speeds are reduced. Biological production plays a major role in maintaining the air-sea equilibrium. An abiotic simulation showed that OWS P would be a source of atmospheric CO2 (1.41 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) if the biological sink of CO2 were removed. The peak net community production in summer compensates for the increased temperature effect on pCO(2), which prevents large outgassing in summer. Oxygen anomalies relative to the temperature-determined saturation value show that there is a seasonal cycle of air-sea flux, with ingassing in winter and outgassing in summer. The net surface oxygen flux is positive (0.8 mol m(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that OWS P is a source of oxygen to the atmosphere. The average primary production is 167 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The 1960-1980 (1958 and 1959 spin-up years removed) mean carbon flux is -1.8 mol C m(-2) yr(-1), indicating that the ocean at OWS P is a sink of atmospheric carbon. The sea-air CO2 flux ranges from -1.2 to -2.3 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) during the 21-year simulation period. This finding emphasizes the need for long-term observations to accurately determine carbon flux budgets. A series of sensitivity experiments indicate that the seasonal variability and overall (21 years) mean of TCO2, pCO(2), DeltapCO(2), and air-sea CO2 flux are strongly dependent on the gas transfer formulation adopted, the total alkalinity near the surface, and the bottom (350 m) value adopted for TCO2. The secular atmospheric pCO(2) upward trend is manifested in the TCO2 concentration within the upper 100 m by an increase of 15 mmol m(-3) in 20 years, consistent with observations at other locations [Winn et al., 1998; Bates, 2001].",,Article,2001.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,241637.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,1,Forest Management,0,0,0,0,"Seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, pCO(2), and O-2 in the eastern subarctic Pacific (ocean weather station Papa) A coupled, one-dimensional ecosystem/carbon flux model is used to simulate the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, O-2, and pCO(2) at ocean weather station Papa (OWS P at 50degreesN, 145degreesW).

The 23-year interannual simulation (1958-1980) is validated with available data and analyzed to extend seasonal and interannual variations beyond the limited observational records. The seasonal cycles of pCO(2) and sea-air CO2 flux are controlled by a combination of thermodynamics, winds, and biological uptake. There is ingassing of CO2 during the fall-winter months when SSTs are colder and wind forcing is vigorous, while there is a much smaller ingassing of CO2 during the summer when sea surface temperatures are warmer and wind speeds are reduced. Biological production plays a major role in maintaining the air-sea equilibrium. An abiotic simulation showed that OWS P would be a source of atmospheric CO2 (1.41 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) if the biological sink of CO2 were removed. The peak net community production in summer compensates for the increased temperature effect on pCO(2), which prevents large outgassing in summer. Oxygen anomalies relative to the temperature-determined saturation value show that there is a seasonal cycle of air-sea flux, with ingassing in winter and outgassing in summer. The net surface oxygen flux is positive (0.8 mol m(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that OWS P is a source of oxygen to the atmosphere. The average primary production is 167 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The 1960-1980 (1958 and 1959 spin-up years removed) mean carbon flux is -1.8 mol C m(-2) yr(-1), indicating that the ocean at OWS P is a sink of atmospheric carbon. The sea-air CO2 flux ranges from -1.2 to -2.3 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) during the 21-year simulation period. This finding emphasizes the need for long-term observations to accurately determine carbon flux budgets. A series of sensitivity experiments indicate that the seasonal variability and overall (21 years) mean of TCO2, pCO(2), DeltapCO(2), and air-sea CO2 flux are strongly dependent on the gas transfer formulation adopted, the total alkalinity near the surface, and the bottom (350 m) value adopted for TCO2. The secular atmospheric pCO(2) upward trend is manifested in the TCO2 concentration within the upper 100 m by an increase of 15 mmol m(-3) in 20 years, consistent with observations at other locations [Winn et al., 1998; Bates, 2001].

796640,Controlling mechanisms of surface partial pressure of CO2 in Jiaozhou Bay during summer and the influence of heavy rain,"Due to the combined effects of natural processes and human activities, carbon source/sink processes and mechanisms in the coastal ocean are becoming more and more important in current ocean carbon cycle research. Based on differences in the ratio of total alkalinity (TA) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) associated with terrestrial input, biological process (production and respiration), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) process (precipitation and dissolution) and CO2 evasion/invasion, we discuss the mechanisms controlling the surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) during summer and the influence of heavy rain, via three cruises performed in mid-June, early July and late July of 2014. In mid-June and in early July, without heavy rain or obvious river input, sea surface pCO(2) ranged from 521 to 1080 atm and from 547 to 998 atm, respectively. The direct input of DIC from sewage and the intense respiration produced large DIC additions and the highest pCO(2) values in the northeast of the bay near the downtown of Qingdao. However, in the west of the bay, significant CaCO3 precipitation led to DIC removal but no obvious increase in pCO(2), which was just close to that in the central area. Due to the shallow depth and longer water residence time in this region, this pattern may be related to the sustained release of CO2 into the atmosphere. In late July, heavy rain promoted river input in the western and eastern portions of JZB. Strong primary production led to a significant decrease in pCO(2) in the western area, with the lowest pCO(2) value of 252 atm. However, in the northeastern area, the intense respiration remained, and the highest pCO(2) value was 1149 atm. The average air-sea CO2 flux in mid-June and early July was 20.23 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and 23.56 mmol m(-2) d-1, respectively. In contrast, in late July, sources became sinks for atmospheric CO2 in the western and central areas of the bay, halving the average air-sea CO2 flux to a value of 10.58 mmol m(-2) d(-1).

In mid-June and in early July, without heavy rain or obvious river input, sea surface pCO(2) ranged from 521 to 1080 atm and from 547 to 998 atm, respectively. The direct input of DIC from sewage and the intense respiration produced large DIC additions and the highest pCO(2) values in the northeast of the bay near the downtown of Qingdao. However, in the west of the bay, significant CaCO3 precipitation led to DIC removal but no obvious increase in pCO(2), which was just close to that in the central area. Due to the shallow depth and longer water residence time in this region, this pattern may be related to the sustained release of CO2 into the atmosphere. In late July, heavy rain promoted river input in the western and eastern portions of JZB. Strong primary production led to a significant decrease in pCO(2) in the western area, with the lowest pCO(2) value of 252 atm. However, in the northeastern area, the intense respiration remained, and the highest pCO(2) value was 1149 atm. The average air-sea CO2 flux in mid-June and early July was 20.23 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and 23.56 mmol m(-2) d-1, respectively. In contrast, in late July, sources became sinks for atmospheric CO2 in the western and central areas of the bay, halving the average air-sea CO2 flux to a value of 10.58 mmol m(-2) d(-1).

713692,Iron fertilisation and century-scale effects of open ocean dissolution of olivine in a simulated CO2 removal experiment,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches are efforts to reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here we use a marine carbon cycle model to investigate the effects of one CDR technique: the open ocean dissolution of the iron-containing mineral olivine. We analyse the maximum CDR potential of an annual dissolution of 3 Pg olivine during the 21st century and focus on the role of the micronutrient iron for the biological carbon pump. Distributing the products of olivine dissolution (bicarbonate, silicic acid, iron) uniformly in the global surface ocean has a maximum CDR potential of 0.57. gC/g-olivine mainly due to the alkalinisation of the ocean, with a significant contribution from the fertilisation of phytoplankton with silicic acid and iron. The part of the CDR caused by ocean fertilisation is not permanent, while the CO2 sequestered by alkalinisation would be stored in the ocean as long as alkalinity is not removed from the system. For high CO2 emission scenarios the CDR potential due to the alkalinity input becomes more efficient over time with increasing ocean acidification. The alkalinity-induced CDR potential scales linearly with the amount of olivine, while the iron-induced CDR saturates at 113 PgC per century (on average similar to 1.1 PgC. yr(-1)) for an iron input rate of 2.3.

156602,Geoengineering potential of artificially enhanced silicate weathering of olivine,"Geoengineering is a proposed action to manipulate Earth's climate in order to counteract global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into consideration, a new mass ratio of CO2 sequestration per olivine dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20% smaller than previously assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid. In our calculations for the Amazon and Congo river catchments, a maximum annual dissolution of 1.8 and 0.4 Pg of olivine seems possible, corresponding to the sequestration of 0.5 and 0.1 Pg of C per year, but these upper limit sequestration rates come at the environmental cost of pH values in the rivers rising to 8.2. Open water dissolution of fine-grained olivine and an enhancement of the biological pump by the rising riverine input of silicic acid might increase our estimate of the carbon sequestration, but additional research is needed here.

We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into consideration, a new mass ratio of CO2 sequestration per olivine dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20% smaller than previously assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid. In our calculations for the Amazon and Congo river catchments, a maximum annual dissolution of 1.8 and 0.4 Pg of olivine seems possible, corresponding to the sequestration of 0.5 and 0.1 Pg of C per year, but these upper limit sequestration rates come at the environmental cost of pH values in the rivers rising to 8.2. Open water dissolution of fine-grained olivine and an enhancement of the biological pump by the rising riverine input of silicic acid might increase our estimate of the carbon sequestration, but additional research is needed here.

4376501,"Variability and stability of anthropogenic CO2 in Antarctic Bottom Water observed in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, 1978-2018","Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is known as a long-term sink for anthropogenic CO2 (C-ant), but the sink is hardly quantified because of the scarcity of observations, specifically at an interannual scale. We present in this paper an original dataset combining 40 years of carbonate system observations in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (Enderby Basin) to evaluate and interpret the interannual variability of C-ant in the AABW. This investigation is based on regular observations collected at the same location (63 degrees E-56.5 degrees S) in the framework of the French observatory OISO from 1998 to 2018 extended by GEOSECS and INDIGO observations (1978, 1985 and 1987). At this location the main sources of AABW sampled is the low-salinity Cape Darnley Bottom Water (CDBW) and the Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). Our calculations reveal that C ant concentrations increased significantly in the AABW, from an average concentration of 7 mu mol kg(-1) calculated for the period 1978-1987 to an average concentration of 13 mu mol kg(-1) for the period 2010-2018. This is comparable to previous estimates in other Southern Ocean (SO) basins, with the exception of bottom water close to formation sites where C-ant concentrations are about twice as large. Our analysis shows that total carbon (C-T) and C ant increasing rates in the AABW are about the same over the period 1978-2018, and we conclude that the long-term change in C-T is mainly due to the uptake of C-ant in the different formation regions. This is, however, modulated by significant interannual to multi-annual variability associated with variations in hydrographic (potential temperature, Theta salinity, S) and bio-geochemical (C-T; total alkalinity, AT; dissolved oxygen, O-2) properties. A surprising result is the apparent stability of C-ant concentrations in recent years despite the increase in C-T and the gradual acceleration of atmospheric CO2.

231335,Life cycle greenhouse gas assessment of a coal-fired power station with calcium looping CO2 capture and offshore geological storage,"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an essential technology for reducing global CO2 emissions in the context of continued fossil fuel use in the power sector. To evaluate the emission reduction potential of any low-carbon generation technology it is necessary to consider emissions over the entire lifetime of the plant. This work examines the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of a 500 MWe pulverised coal-fired power plant with post-combustion Calcium Looping (CaL) and off-shore geological storage. CaL uses solid CO2-sorbent derived from abundant and non-toxic limestone (CaCO3) and is currently being piloted at the 1-2 MWth scale in Europe (Spain and Germany). This technology promises to be very competitive with the more mature chemical absorption processes, with the potential to reduce the efficiency and cost penalties of CO2 capture. We demonstrate that the emission intensity of a coal-fired power plant with CaL is at least comparable with one using MEA-solvent technology (i.e., similar to 229 gCO(2)e/kWh vs. 225 gCO(2)e/kWh). However, there is significant potential for additional emissions reduction when considering the recarbonation of exhausted sorbent in landfill.

To evaluate the emission reduction potential of any low-carbon generation technology it is necessary to consider emissions over the entire lifetime of the plant. This work examines the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of a 500 MWe pulverised coal-fired power plant with post-combustion Calcium Looping (CaL) and off-shore geological storage. CaL uses solid CO2-sorbent derived from abundant and non-toxic limestone (CaCO3) and is currently being piloted at the 1-2 MWth scale in Europe (Spain and Germany). This technology promises to be very competitive with the more mature chemical absorption processes, with the potential to reduce the efficiency and cost penalties of CO2 capture. We demonstrate that the emission intensity of a coal-fired power plant with CaL is at least comparable with one using MEA-solvent technology (i.e., similar to 229 gCO(2)e/kWh vs. 225 gCO(2)e/kWh). However, there is significant potential for additional emissions reduction when considering the recarbonation of exhausted sorbent in landfill. Furthermore, a coal-fired power plant with CaL could be carbon-neutral - or even achieve a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. That is, if the exhausted sorbent is used in the cement industry substituting the input of fresh-limestone; or if the exhausted sorbent is disposed in the ocean forming bicarbonate.",,Article,2012.0,1.0,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,231335.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,1,Agroforestry,0,0,0,0,"Life cycle greenhouse gas assessment of a coal-fired power station with calcium looping CO2 capture and offshore geological storage Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an essential technology for reducing global CO2 emissions in the context of continued fossil fuel use in the power sector.

724896,"Reactions between basalt and CO2-rich seawater at 250 and 350 degrees C, 500 bars: Implications for the CO2 sequestration into the modern oceanic crust and the composition of hydrothermal vent fluid in the CO2-rich early ocean","This study aims to understand how basaltic rocks absorb CO2 in high-temperature alteration zones in the subseafloor, and to reconstruct hydrothermal alteration processes such as carbonatization of Archean greenstones. To this end, we conducted two laboratory experiments, simulating hydrothermal reactions between basalt (synthesized under quartz-fayalite-magnetite oxygen fugacity) and CO2-rich NaCl fluid (pH = 6.5 at 25 degrees C) at high temperature and pressure. As the water/rock reactions progressed at 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C, 500 bars, total carbonic acid concentration (Sigma CO2) reduced from its initial 400 mmol/kg to near 0 and 100 mmol/kg, respectively, meanwhile calcite was formed in the basalt as an alteration mineral. This indicates that calcite destabilizes as temperature increases in the H2O-CO2-basalt system and that crustal basalts can absorb almost all CO2 in the fluid as calcite, at least at temperatures and initial CO2 concentrations below 250 degrees C and 400 mmol/kg, respectively. Although the second aim was realized in the experiments, minerals such as sericite, dolomite, ankerite, and siderite present in Archean greenstones were not identified in the alteration products, possibly because K, Mg, and Fe were lacking in the initial solutions. Steady-state concentrations of SiO2, Mg, and K in the fluids during water/rock reactions were similar to those of high-temperature fluids (>250 degrees C) in modern basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems. However, the final experimental pH(in-situ) was 6.6 and 7.2 at 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C, respectively, higher than that in modern hydrothermal fluids (approximately 5) and higher than the neutral pH (5.5-5.6) at 250-350 degrees C, 500 bars. The results suggest that the presence of abundant CO2 in the initial fluid induced carbonatization of basalt; consequently, pH was buffered by precipitation and dissolution of calcite. Because pH(in-situ) was elevated, the dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations in the fluid were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of modern hydrothermal fluids. In modern oceans, high-temperature hydrothermal vent fluids are the second-largest iron source (after riverine input). However, because alkaline, metal-poor hydrothermal fluids are generated in CO2-rich systems, CO2-rich seafloor hydrothermal systems may have behaved as iron sinks in early oceans.

Although the second aim was realized in the experiments, minerals such as sericite, dolomite, ankerite, and siderite present in Archean greenstones were not identified in the alteration products, possibly because K, Mg, and Fe were lacking in the initial solutions. Steady-state concentrations of SiO2, Mg, and K in the fluids during water/rock reactions were similar to those of high-temperature fluids (>250 degrees C) in modern basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems. However, the final experimental pH(in-situ) was 6.6 and 7.2 at 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C, respectively, higher than that in modern hydrothermal fluids (approximately 5) and higher than the neutral pH (5.5-5.6) at 250-350 degrees C, 500 bars. The results suggest that the presence of abundant CO2 in the initial fluid induced carbonatization of basalt; consequently, pH was buffered by precipitation and dissolution of calcite. Because pH(in-situ) was elevated, the dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations in the fluid were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of modern hydrothermal fluids. In modern oceans, high-temperature hydrothermal vent fluids are the second-largest iron source (after riverine input). However, because alkaline, metal-poor hydrothermal fluids are generated in CO2-rich systems, CO2-rich seafloor hydrothermal systems may have behaved as iron sinks in early oceans.

671620,Contribution of iron to the energetics of CO2 sequestration in Mg-silicates-based rock,"The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the contribution of iron to the energy requirements of a process for producing magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)(2)) from alkaline-earth Mg-silicate rock that contains iron, such as serpentinite. Once produced Mg(OH)(2) could be used to sequester carbon either by direct mineralization at a power plant or from the air, or as a means to deliver alkalinity to the ocean thus tending to restore oceanic pH and sequester atmospheric carbon. Fe-containing by-products obtained from producing Mg(OH)(2) are considered to be beneficial as secondary raw materials for iron-and steel-making industries. It has been proposed that this could further reduce CO2 emissions as well as raw material costs. However, this study hypothesized that the extent of this benefit, if any, would depend on energy intensity of reactions involving iron compounds. Using Aspen Plus (R) software, the contribution of iron to the energy input requirement of CO2 sequestration was modeled. Results obtained showed that the extraction of iron from Mg-silicate minerals could present a significant energy penalty to the mineralization process. Exergy analysis shows that at the experimental optimal temperature of 400 degrees C, the energy penalties of having iron oxide (FeO), hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) as dominant iron compounds results are (for 10 wt.% Fe in the rock) an increase of 0.3 GJ/t CO2 (7%), 0.7 GJ/t CO2 (20%) and 2.2 GJ/t CO2 (60%) respectively when compared to an iron-free base case. Recovery of input raw material, ammonium sulfate (AS) by evaporative crystallization is a major energy intensive step in this process. However, our model applied mechanical vapor recompression (MVR), which resulted in a significant reduction in energy demand. It can be concluded that the benefit of producing useful Fe by-products comes with an energy penalty, the extent of which varies with the form of Fe compound in the mineral. The findings in this paper are useful in determining which Mg-silicate-based rocks would be energy efficient for use. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Many of these clasts were likely derived from a fringing reef and from the sandy flat that separates the reef from the island's north shore. The scattered clasts include no fewer than 200 coral boulders, mapped herein for the first time and mainly found hundreds of meters inland. Many of these are complete colonies of the brain coral Diploria strigosa. Other coral species represented include Orbicella (formerly Montastraea) annularis, Porites astreoides, and Acropora palmata. Associated bioclastic carbonate sand locally contains articulated cobble-size valves of the lucine Codakia orbicularis and entire conch shells of Strombus gigas, mollusks that still inhabit the sandy shallows between the island's north shore and a fringing reef beyond. Imbricated limestone slabs are clustered near some of the coral boulders. In addition, fields of scattered limestone boulders and cobbles near sea level extend mainly southward from limestone sources as much as 1 km inland. Radiocarbon ages have been obtained from 27 coral clasts, 8 lucine valves, and 3 conch shells. All these additional ages predate 1500 cal yr CE, all but 2 are in the range 1000-1500 cal yr CE, and 16 of 22 brain coral ages cluster in the range 1200-1480 cal yr CE. The event marked by these coral and mollusk clasts likely occurred in the last centuries before Columbus (before 1492 CE). The pre-Columbian deposits surpass Anegada's previously reported evidence for extreme waves in post-Columbian time. The coarsest of the modern storm deposits consist of coral rubble that lines the north shore and sandy fans on the south shore; neither of these storm deposits extends more than 50 m inland. More extensive overwash, perhaps by the 1755 Lisbon tsunami, is marked primarily by a sheet of sand and shells found mainly below sea level beneath the floors of modern salt ponds. This sheet extends more than 1 km southward from the north shore and dates to the interval 1650-1800 cal yr CE. Unlike the pre-Columbian deposits, it lacks coarse clasts from the reef or reef flat; its shell assemblage is instead dominated by cerithid gastropods that were merely stirred up from a marine pond in the island's interior. In their inland extent and clustered pre-Columbian ages, the coral clasts and associated deposits suggest extreme waves unrivaled in recent millennia at Anegada.

160631,Drivers of the carbonate system seasonal variations in a Mediterranean gulf,"The effects of different physical and biogeochemical drivers on the carbonate system were investigated in a semi-enclosed coastal area characterized by high alkalinity riverine discharge (Gulf of Trieste, Northern Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean Sea). Our 2-year time-series showed that a large part of the seasonal carbonate chemistry variation was controlled by the large seasonal change of seawater temperature, though air-sea CO2 exchange, biological activity (primary production-respiration), and riverine inputs also exerted a significant influence. With the exception of summer, the Gulf of Trieste was a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, showing a very strong CO2 fluxes from atmosphere into the sea (-16.10 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) during high wind speed event of north easterly Bora wind. The CO2 influx was particularly evident in winter, when the biological activity was at minimum and the low seawater temperature enhanced CO2 solubility. During spring, the drawdown of CO2 by primary production overwhelmed the CO2 physical pump, driving a significant decrease of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), [CO2], and increase of pH(T25) (degrees C). In summer the primary production in surface waters occurred with the same intensity as respiration in the bottom layer, so the net biological effect on the carbonate system was very low and the further reduction of seawater CO2 concentration observed was mainly due to carbon dioxide degassing induced by high seawater temperature. Finally, during autumn the respiration was the predominant process, which determined an overall increase of DIC, [CO2], and decrease of pH(T25) (degrees C). This was particularly evident when the breakdown of summer stratification occurred and a large amount of CO2, generated by respiration and segregated below the pycnocline, was released back to the whole water column. Local rivers also significantly affected the carbonate system by direct input of total alkalinity (A(T)) coming from the chemical weathering of carbonate rocks, which dominate the river watershed. Our finding clearly demonstrates a high A(T) concentration in low salinity surface waters (A(T) max = 2742.8 mu mol kg(-1)) and a negative A(T)-salinity correlation. As a result the Gulf of Trieste revealed a low Revelle factor (10.1) and one of the highest buffer capacities of the Mediterranean Sea (ss(Dic) = 0.31 mmol kg(-1)), which allows the system to store a significant amount of atmospheric CO2 with a small decrease of seawater pH.

733032,Anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the South Atlantic western basin,"The meridional WOCE line A17 was conducted during the austral summer of 1994 parallel to the eastern South American coast, from 55 degrees S to 10 degrees S, where one of the main limbs of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). i.e., the southward-flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) is found. Full-depth profiles of pH, total alkalinity and total inorganic carbon were measured and checked with analytical CO2 certified reference materials (CRMs), providing a high-quality dataset with good internal consistency for the CO2 system parameters that is well suited for anthropogenic CO2 (C-ANT) estimation. For the first time in the western Atlantic basin the C-ANT has been calculated using four independent approaches and results are compared. The methods considered are the CFC-based TTD method and the (phi C-T degrees TrOCA and Delta C* carbon system-based back-calculation methods. All four methods have produced C-ANT distribution patterns that are in general good agreement: maximum concentrations of C-ANT (50-60 mu mol kg(-1)) are predicted for the upper warm South Atlantic central waters from the tropical gyres, while the minima (similar to 5 mu mol kg(-1)) are located in the old northward-flowing branch of Circumpolar Deep Water. There are, however, some discrepancies detected. The TrOCA method yields the highest overall [C-ANT] values, even over the theoretical limit of C-ANT saturation for 1994 in the upper layers. The Delta C* approach consistently yielded negative estimates of C-ANT below 2800 dbar, even after correcting a reported - 8 mu mol kg(-1) bias in the alkalinity measurements of the WOCE A17 line. The main overall difference between the four methods corresponds to the relative C-ANT maximum associated with the lower limb of NADW: this structure is well identified in the phi C-T degrees and TTD methods but seems to disappear in the case of TrOCA and Delta C*. In agreement with other intercomparison studies of C-ANT, the specific inventories are significantly higher (similar to 45%) than those reported in the GLODAP database obtained from the Delta C*. method. This suggests that the South Atlantic stores more C-ANT than initially expected, particularly towards the southernmost tip of the WOCE A17 line, close to the Southern Ocean. The phi C-T degrees, TrOCA and TTD methods confirm an increasing tendency of C-ANT specific inventories south from the Equator, while the Delta C* method shows a decreasing trend south from 35 degrees S.

694107,Weddell Sea turned from source to sink for atmospheric CO2 between pre-industrial time and present,"Using contemporary CO2 data from the subsurface Weddell Sea, the source/sink function of this region against the changing atmospheric CO2 level has been investigated. As in the central Weddell Sea, surface water is supplied by upwelling of subsurface water, the CO2 content is also forced by it. TCO2 data of four cruises were used to determine a robust value for the subsurface Warm Deep Water (WDW). After accounting for biological activity in the surface layer and salinity differences between the subsurface and surface waters, the forcing CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) was calculated from the TCO2 of the WDW and the conservative alkalinity as taken from the literature. As the WDW contains negligible anthropogenic CO2, the pCO(2) forcing by the WDW has been prevalent both in the pre-industrial and modem Weddell Sea. The calculated pCO(2) forcing amounts to 300-310 muatm at a minimum in late winter/early spring and possibly 30 muatm more during spring and summer. This figure does not represent the actual pCO(2), but rather the value before air-sea exchange gets effective. Hence, in pre-industrial times when the atmospheric pCO(2) was about 280 muatm, the Weddell Sea must have been a relatively strong source of atmospheric CO2. Because of the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 levels to more than the pCO(2) forcing by the WDW, the Weddell Sea turned into a CO, sink in recent times. The storage of anthropogenic CO2 in the Weddell Sea surface layer is estimated to be 4.1 Mol C m(-2).

This figure does not represent the actual pCO(2), but rather the value before air-sea exchange gets effective. Hence, in pre-industrial times when the atmospheric pCO(2) was about 280 muatm, the Weddell Sea must have been a relatively strong source of atmospheric CO2. Because of the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 levels to more than the pCO(2) forcing by the WDW, the Weddell Sea turned into a CO, sink in recent times. The storage of anthropogenic CO2 in the Weddell Sea surface layer is estimated to be 4.1 Mol C m(-2).

229206,Annual cycle and interannual variability of ecosystem metabolism in a temperate climate embayment,"We have studied the net and gross metabolism of Tomales Bay, a temperate climate estuary in northern California. Tomales Bay has proved to be heterotrophic, implying that the bay oxidizes a subsidy of organic carbon from outside the system, in excess of inorganic nutrients supplied to it from outside and in addition to material cycling within it. Net organic oxidation releases dissolved inorganic nutrients, and the system exports these dissolved inorganic products. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus is exported to the ocean via mixing and constitutes the most direct record of net ecosystem production (NEP). Excess dissolved inorganic nitrogen is lost to denitrification. Excess dissolved inorganic carbon largely results in alkalinity elevation and hydrographic export of alkalinity due to sulfate reduction. The negative NEP of this system results in little release of CO2 to the atmosphere, because of this alkalinity elevation. A major purpose of the study was to ascertain the relative importance of various sources of organic material supplied to the system from outside its boundaries and undergoing net reactions within it. In order to address the question, we used stoichiometrically linked whole-system budgets of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The difference between dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) fluxes to and from the bay is a measure of net internal sources or sinks of DIP and is used as a quantitative index of NEP, with the assumption that the C:P ratio of organic matter is constant (similar to 106:1). The system is thus defined in terms of water column dissolved material composition; this definition includes time, as well as space. Net changes in the standing stocks of dissolved materials can originate from (spatial) transport to or from the system or from internal (temporal) transformations between the dissolved and particulate materials (i.e., changes in organic storage). Over the 8-yr study, the system respired 12 mmol.m(-2).d(-1) more organic C than the internal system primary production of similar to 100 mmol.m(-2)d(-1). The system is thus heterotrophic by similar to 10%, with substantial seasonality in the extent of heterotrophy. By deconvoluting the time series of NEP into a seasonal cycle and interannual variation, we infer that terrestrial and marine sources each account for about half of the carbon required to support negative NEP in this system, but with quite different turnover time scales. Temporal response of NEP to terrigenous input appears to be extremely modulated, so that there is no obvious immediate (same year) response to extreme interannual variation in terrigenous organic loading. In contrast, NEP responds both interannually and seasonally to marine organic inputs.

By deconvoluting the time series of NEP into a seasonal cycle and interannual variation, we infer that terrestrial and marine sources each account for about half of the carbon required to support negative NEP in this system, but with quite different turnover time scales. Temporal response of NEP to terrigenous input appears to be extremely modulated, so that there is no obvious immediate (same year) response to extreme interannual variation in terrigenous organic loading. In contrast, NEP responds both interannually and seasonally to marine organic inputs. We interpret the differences in response to loading of terrestrial vs. marine organic matter as reflecting differences in the reactivity of these carbon reservoirs. Article "
229206,Annual cycle and interannual variability of ecosystem metabolism in a temperate climate embayment,"We have studied the net and gross metabolism of Tomales Bay, a temperate climate estuary in northern California. Tomales Bay has proved to be heterotrophic, implying that the bay oxidizes a subsidy of organic carbon from outside the system, in excess of inorganic nutrients supplied to it from outside and in addition to material cycling within it. Net organic oxidation releases dissolved inorganic nutrients, and the system exports these dissolved inorganic products. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus is exported to the ocean via mixing and constitutes the most direct record of net ecosystem production (NEP). Excess dissolved inorganic nitrogen is lost to denitrification. Excess dissolved inorganic carbon largely results in alkalinity elevation and hydrographic export of alkalinity due to sulfate reduction. The negative NEP of this system results in little release of CO2 to the atmosphere, because of this alkalinity elevation. A major purpose of the study was to ascertain the relative importance of various sources of organic material supplied to the system from outside its boundaries and undergoing net reactions within it. In order to address the question, we used stoichiometrically linked whole-system budgets of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The difference between dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) fluxes to and from the bay is a measure of net internal sources or sinks of DIP and is used as a quantitative index of NEP, with the assumption that the C:P ratio of organic matter is constant (similar to 106:1). The system is thus defined in terms of water column dissolved material composition; this definition includes time, as well as space. Net changes in the standing stocks of dissolved materials can originate from (spatial) transport to or from the system or from internal (temporal) transformations between the dissolved and particulate materials (i.e., changes in organic storage).

564048,Carbon dynamics and community production in the Mississippi River plume,"Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TAlk), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were determined in the Mississippi River plume during five cruises conducted in the spring, summer, and fall. In contrast to many other large rivers, both DIC and TAlk were higher in river water than in seawater. Substantial losses of DIC, relative to TAlk, occurred within the plume, particularly at intermediate salinities. DIC removal was accompanied by high DO, high pH, and nutrient depletion, and was attributed to high phytoplankton production. As a result, the carbonate saturation in the plume became much higher than in ocean and river waters. A mixing model was used to determine DIC removal. We provide evidence that the use of a two-end-member (river and ocean) mixing model was valid during late summer and fall (low discharge period). However, for other periods we used salinity and TAlk to delineate a mixing model that included two river end members and an ocean end member.

335679,Electrochemical acceleration of chemical weathering as an energetically feasible approach to mitigating anthropogenic climate change,"We describe an approach to CO2 capture and storage from the atmosphere that involves enhancing the solubility of CO2 in the ocean by a process equivalent to the natural silicate weathering reaction. HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3- without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit-and with the appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100-400 kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of population centers. It may also be useful on a regional scale for protection of coral reefs from further ocean acidification.

377650,The role of forest trees and their mycorrhizal fungi in carbonate rock weathering and its significance for global carbon cycling,"On million-year timescales, carbonate rock weathering exerts no net effect on atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, on timescales of decades-to-centuries, it can contribute to sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 and increase land-ocean alkalinity flux, counteracting ocean acidification. Historical evidence indicates this flux is sensitive to land use change, and recent experimental evidence suggests that trees and their associated soil microbial communities are major drivers of continental mineral weathering. Here, we review key physical and chemical mechanisms by which the symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi of forest tree roots potentially enhance carbonate rock weathering. Evidence from our ongoing field study at the UK's national pinetum confirms increased weathering of carbonate rocks by a wide range of gymnosperm and angiosperm tree species that form arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal partnerships. We demonstrate that calcite-containing rock grains under EM tree species weather significantly faster than those under AM trees, an effect linked to greater soil acidification by EM trees. Weathering and corresponding alkalinity export are likely to increase with rising atmospheric CO2 and associated climate change. Our analyses suggest that strategic planting of fast-growing EM angiosperm taxa on calcite- and dolomite-rich terrain might accelerate the transient sink for atmospheric CO2 and slow rates of ocean acidification. Carbonate mineral weathering in forest soils could act as a transient sink for anthropogenic CO (2) over human timescales of decades to centuries.

207657,"Dramatic Variability of the Carbonate System at a Temperate Coastal Ocean Site (Beaufort, North Carolina, USA) Is Regulated by Physical and Biogeochemical Processes on Multiple Timescales","Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from anthropogenic sources is acidifying marine environments resulting in potentially dramatic consequences for the physical, chemical and biological functioning of these ecosystems. If current trends continue, mean ocean pH is expected to decrease by similar to 0.2 units over the next similar to 50 years. Yet, there is also substantial temporal variability in pH and other carbon system parameters in the ocean resulting in regions that already experience change that exceeds long-term projected trends in pH. This points to short-term dynamics as an important layer of complexity on top of long-term trends. Thus, in order to predict future climate change impacts, there is a critical need to characterize the natural range and dynamics of the marine carbonate system and the mechanisms responsible for observed variability. Here, we present pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at time intervals spanning 1 hour to >1 year from a dynamic, coastal, temperate marine system (Beaufort Inlet, Beaufort NC USA) to characterize the carbonate system at multiple time scales. Daily and seasonal variation of the carbonate system is largely driven by temperature, alkalinity and the balance between primary production and respiration, but high frequency change (hours to days) is further influenced by water mass movement (e. g. tides) and stochastic events (e. g. storms). Both annual (similar to 0.3 units) and diurnal (similar to 0.1 units) variability in coastal ocean acidity are similar in magnitude to 50 year projections of ocean acidity associated with increasing atmospheric CO2. The environmental variables driving these changes highlight the importance of characterizing the complete carbonate system rather than just pH. Short-term dynamics of ocean carbon parameters may already exert significant pressure on some coastal marine ecosystems with implications for ecology, biogeochemistry and evolution and this shorter term variability layers additive effects and complexity, including extreme values, on top of long-term trends in ocean acidification.",,Article,2013.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,207657.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,1,Forest Management,0,0,0,0,"Dramatic Variability of the Carbonate System at a Temperate Coastal Ocean Site (Beaufort, North Carolina, USA) Is Regulated by Physical and Biogeochemical Processes on Multiple Timescales Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from anthropogenic sources is acidifying marine environments resulting in potentially dramatic consequences for the physical, chemical and biological functioning of these ecosystems.

923431,Quantifying and Comparing Effects of Climate Engineering Methods on the Earth System,"To contribute to a quantitative comparison of climate engineering (CE) methods, we assess atmosphere-, ocean-, and land-based CE measures with respect to Earth system effects consistently within one comprehensive model. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with prognostic carbon cycle to compare solar radiation management (SRM) by stratospheric sulfur injection and two carbon dioxide removal methods: afforestation and ocean alkalinization. The CE model experiments are designed to offset the effect of fossil-fuel burning on global mean surface air temperature under the RCP8.5 scenario to follow or get closer to the RCP4.5 scenario. Our results show the importance of feedbacks in the CE effects. For example, as a response to SRM the land carbon uptake is enhanced by 92Gt by the year 2100 compared to the reference RCP8.5 scenario due to reduced soil respiration thus reducing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we show that normalizations allow for a better comparability of different CE methods. For example, we find that due to compensating processes such as biogeophysical effects of afforestation more carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere by afforestation than by alkalinization to reach the same global warming reduction.

719635,"Air-sea CO2 exchange in a subtropical estuarine-coral reef system, Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii","The present study represents the first time-series evaluation of air-sea CO2 exchange for a coastal marine system of a subtropical high island of the Pacific.

The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and the air-sea CO2 exchange flux were calculated using TA, DIC, atmospheric CO2 at sea level, and five wind speed relationships for gas transfer velocity. pCO(2) values were above the atmospheric level (average: 378 mu atm) throughout Kaneohe Bay (400-500 mu atm) and Kaneohe Stream waters (600-1300 mu atm) during baseline conditions. pCO(2) levels above atmospheric in bay water were driven mainly by calcification while pCO(2) levels above atmospheric in stream water were driven mainly by remineralization of terrestrial organic matter. pCO(2) values above the atmospheric level were observed in surface water that extended almost 4 kin beyond the boundary of the bay indicating that processes inside the bay such as calcification affect the inorganic carbon properties of the surrounding near shore open ocean. Precipitation from storm events in the Kaneohe watershed increases stream and land runoff that brings excess nutrients to bay waters. These excess nutrients stimulate phytoplankton blooms which draw down CO2 in Kaneohe Bay water through photosynthesis.

The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and the air-sea CO2 exchange flux were calculated using TA, DIC, atmospheric CO2 at sea level, and five wind speed relationships for gas transfer velocity. pCO(2) values were above the atmospheric level (average: 378 mu atm) throughout Kaneohe Bay (400-500 mu atm) and Kaneohe Stream waters (600-1300 mu atm) during baseline conditions. pCO(2) levels above atmospheric in bay water were driven mainly by calcification while pCO(2) levels above atmospheric in stream water were driven mainly by remineralization of terrestrial organic matter. pCO(2) values above the atmospheric level were observed in surface water that extended almost 4 kin beyond the boundary of the bay indicating that processes inside the bay such as calcification affect the inorganic carbon properties of the surrounding near shore open ocean. Precipitation from storm events in the Kaneohe watershed increases stream and land runoff that brings excess nutrients to bay waters. These excess nutrients stimulate phytoplankton blooms which draw down CO2 in Kaneohe Bay water through photosynthesis. Despite the significant effects of the storms, Kaneohe Bay was a net annual source of CO2 to the atmosphere of -0.046 Gmol C year(-1) (-0.55 kton C year(-1)) with an area-specific flux of -1.45 mol C m(-2) year(-1) (-17.4 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The source of CO2 in Kaneohe Bay could be stronger on a long-term basis since dry years may be stronger net annual sources than wet years such as this study period.

5298924,Mesozoic mafic alkaline magmatism of southern Scandinavia,"More than 100 volcanic necks in central Scania (southern Sweden) are the product of Jurassic continental rift-related mafic alkaline magmatism at the southwest margin of the Baltic Shield. They are mainly basanites, with rarer melanephelinites. Both rock groups display overlapping primitive Mg-numbers, Cr and Ni contents, steep chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns (La-N /Yb-N = 17-27) and an overall enrichment in incompatible elements. However, the melanephelinites are more alkaline and have stronger high field strength element enrichment than the basanites. The existence of distinct primary magmas is also indicated by heterogeneity in highly incompatible element ratios (e.g. Zr/Nb, La/Nb). Trace element modelling indicates that the magmas were generated by comparably low degrees of melting of a heterogeneous mantle source. Such a source can best be explained by a metasomatic overprint of the mantle lithosphere by percolating evolved melts. The former existence of such alkaline trace element-enriched melts can be demonstrated by inversion of the trace element content of green-core clinopyroxenes and anorthoclase which occur as xenocrysts in the melanephelinites and are interpreted as being derived from crystallization of evolved mantle melts. Jurassic magmatic activity in Scania was coeval with the generation of nephelinites in the nearby Egersund Basin (Norwegian North Sea). Both Scanian and North Sea alkaline magmas share similar trace element characteristics. Mantle enrichment processes at the southwest margin of the Baltic Shield and the North Sea Basin generated trace element signatures similar to those of ocean island basalts (e.g. low Zr/Nb and La/Nb) but there are no indications of plume activity during the Mesozoic in this area. On the contrary, the short duration of rifting, absence of extensive lithospheric thinning, and low magma volumes argue against a Mesozoic mantle plume. It seems likely that the metasomatic imprint resulted from the earlier Permo-Carboniferous rifting episode which affected the entire study area and clearly was accompanied by plume activity (Ernst and Buchan in American Geophysical Union, pp 297-337, 1997). Renewed rifting in Jurassic times triggered decompression melting in the volatile-enriched lithospheric mantle and the alkaline melts generated inherited the earlier ""stored"" plume signature.",,Article,2004.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,2.0,0.0,5298924.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,1,AR,0,0,0,0,"Mesozoic mafic alkaline magmatism of southern Scandinavia More than 100 volcanic necks in central Scania (southern Sweden) are the product of Jurassic continental rift-related mafic alkaline magmatism at the southwest margin of the Baltic Shield.

5298923,"The evolution of stable silicon isotopes in a coastal carbonate aquifer on Rottnest Island, Western Australia","Dissolved silicon (dSi) is a key nutrient in the oceans, but data regarding Si isotopes in coastal aquifers are not widely available. Here we investigate the Si isotopic composition of 12 fresh and 16 saline groundwater samples from Rottnest Island, Western Australia, which forms part of the world's most extensive aeolianite deposit (the Tamala Limestone formation). In total, two bedrock samples were also collected from Rottnest Island for Si isotope analysis. The delta Si-30 values of groundwater samples ranged from -0.4% to +3.6% with an average +1.6 %, and the rock samples were -0.8% and -0.1 %. The increase in delta Si-30 values in fresh groundwater is attributed to the removal of the lighter Si isotopes into secondary minerals and potentially also adsorption onto Fe (oxy)hydroxides. The positive correlations between delta Si-30 values and dSi concentrations (rho = 0.59; p = 0.02) and delta Si-30 values and Cl, but not dSi and Cl concentrations, are consistent with vertical mixing between the younger fresh groundwater and the deeper groundwater, which have undergone a greater degree of water-rock interactions. This has produced a spatial pattern in delta Si-30 across the aquifer due to the local hydrogeology, resulting in a correlation between delta Si-30 and tritium activities when considering all groundwater types (rho = 0.68; p = 0.0002). In the deeper aquifer, the inverse correlation between dSi and Cl concentrations (rho = 0.79; p = 0.04) for the more saline groundwater is attributed to groundwater mixing with local seawater that is depleted in dSi (< 3.6 mu M). Our results from this well-constrained island aquifer system demonstrate that stable Si isotopes usefully reflect the degree of water-aquifer interac-tions, which is related to groundwater residence time and local hydrogeology.

5298917,Seasonal cycles of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon at high and mid latitudes in the North Pacific Ocean during the Skaugran cruises: determination of new production and nutrient uptake ratios,"The results of a 2-yr monitoring program in the North Pacific (March 1995-April 1997) using the commercial cargo carrier M/V Skaugran are presented in this paper. Seasonal changes in macronutrients (nitrate, phosphate and silicate), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) were recorded in the surface waters of 12 major provinces of the North Pacific Ocean (35-55degreesN). North of the subarctic boundary (40degreesN), nitrate rarely decreased to below detection limit except in the more near-shore provinces, with nitrate concentrations remaining as high as 8-9 mumol kg(-1) in the summer in the northern provinces of the Bering Sea, the central and western subarctic Pacific. There were also strong latitudinal nutrient gradients. In most provinces of the subarctic Pacific, there was little interannual change in the nutrient cycles, except in the western subarctic Pacific where nitrate concentration fell to 2.6 pmol kg(-1) in the summer of 1996. We suggest that this large nitrate depletion was due to enhanced diatom production triggered by the supply of iron from the Asian continent. The relationship between salinity-normalized TA and DIC revealed that calcification was low or negligible in the surface waters of the Bering Sea and the western subarctic Pacific. In contrast, the percent of CaCO(3) production to organic carbon production was found to be at times as high as 70-75% in the eastern subarctic Pacific and the southern region off east Japan. This study also revealed east-west contrasts in the seasonal nutrient-depletion ratios. In the east, the elevated DIC:NO(3) ratios and low Si(OH)(4):NO(3) ratios were due to high CaCO(3) production and low diatom production in surface waters. On the contrary, in the western subarctic Pacific and the Bering Sea, the low Redfieldian DIC:NO(3) ratios and the high Si(OH)(4):NO(3) ratios were due to low calcification and high diatom production. The annual new production was estimated from the seasonal drawdown of nitrate at the surface. It ranged from 10.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the subtropical gyre to 76-83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the western subarctic Pacific. Overall, horizontal advection was the major source of uncertainty in the estimation of new production. Finally, the net removal of carbon from the surface by the biological pump was then estimated to be 0.58 Gt C yr(-1) north of 35degreesN in the Pacific Ocean.

5298911,Proterozoic mountain building in Peninsular India: an analysis based primarily on alkaline rock distribution,"Peninsular India was assembled into a continental block c. 3 million km(2) in area as a result of collisions throughout the length of a 4000 kin long S-shaped mountain belt that was first recognized from the continuity of strike of highly deformed Proterozoic granulites and gneisses. More recently the recognition of a variety of tectonic indicators, including occurrences of ophiolitic slivers, Andean-margin type rocks, a collisional rift and a foreland basin, as well as many structural and isotopic age studies have helped to clarify the history of this Great Indian Proterozoic Fold Belt. We here complement those studies by considering the occurrence of deformed alkaline rocks and carbonatites (DARCs) in the Great Indian Proterozoic Fold Belt. One aim of this study is to test the recently published idea that DARCs result from the deformation of alkaline rocks and carbonatites (ARCs) originally intruded into intra-continental rifts and preserved on rifted continental margins. The suggestion is that ARCs from those margins are transformed into DARCs during continental, or arc-continental, collisions. If that idea is valid, DARCs lie on rifted continental margins and on coincident younger suture zones; they occur in places where ancient oceans have both opened and closed. Locating sutures within mountain belts has often proved difficult and has sometimes been controversial. If the new idea is valid, DARC distributions may help to reduce controversy. This paper concentrates on the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, where alkaline rock occurrences are best known. Less complete information from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan has enabled us to define a line of 47 unevenly distributed DARCs with individual outcrop lengths of between 30 in and 30 km that extends along the full 4000 km length of the Great Indian Proterozoic Fold Belt.

If that idea is valid, DARCs lie on rifted continental margins and on coincident younger suture zones; they occur in places where ancient oceans have both opened and closed.

5298910,Geology and Isotope Geochemistry of the Dongzhongla Pb-Zn Deposit in Tibet: Implications for the Origin of the Ore-Forming Fluids and Storage Condition of Certain Metals,"As a newly discovered medium-sized deposit (proven Pb+Zn resources of 0.23 Mt, 9.43% Pb and 8.73% Zn), the Dongzhongla skarn Pb-Zn deposit is located in the northern margin of the eastern Gangdese, central Lhasa block. Based on the geological conditions in this deposit of ore-forming fluids, H, O, C, S, Pb, Sr, and noble gas isotopic compositions were analyzed. Results show that O-18(SMOW) of quartz and calcite ranged from -9.85 to 4.17 parts per thousand, and D-SMOW ranged from -124.7 to -99.6 parts per thousand (where SMOW is the standard mean ocean water), indicating magma fluids mixed with meteoric water in ore-forming fluids. The C-13(PDB) and O-18(SMOW) values of calcite range from -1.4 to -1.1 parts per thousand and from 5.3 to 15.90 parts per thousand, respectively, show compositions consistent with the carbonate limestone in the surrounding rocks, implying that the carbon was primarily sourced from the dissolution of carbonate strata in the Luobadui Formation. The ore S-34 composition varied in a narrow range of 2.8 to 5.7 parts per thousand, mostly between 4 parts per thousand and 5 parts per thousand. The total sulfur isotopic value S-34 was 4.7 parts per thousand with characteristics of magmatic sulfur. The He-3/He-4 values of pyrite and galena ranged from 0.101 to 5.7Ra, lower than those of mantle-derived fluids (6 +/- 1 Ra), but higher than those of the crust (0.01-0.05 Ra), and therefore classified as a crust-mantle mixed source. The Pb isotopic composition for Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, and Pb-208/Pb-204 values of the ores were in the ranges of 18.628-18.746, 15.698-15.802, and 39.077-39.430, respectively, consistent with the Pb isotopic composition of magmatic rocks in the deposit, classified as upper-crust lead. The ore lead was likely sourced partially from the crustal basement of the Lhasa Terrane. The initial (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) value from five sulfide samples ranged from 0.71732 to 0.72767, and associated ore-forming fluids were mainly sourced from the partial melting of the upper-crust materials.

The He-3/He-4 values of pyrite and galena ranged from 0.101 to 5.7Ra, lower than those of mantle-derived fluids (6 +/- 1 Ra), but higher than those of the crust (0.01-0.05 Ra), and therefore classified as a crust-mantle mixed source. The Pb isotopic composition for Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, and Pb-208/Pb-204 values of the ores were in the ranges of 18.628-18.746, 15.698-15.802, and 39.077-39.430, respectively, consistent with the Pb isotopic composition of magmatic rocks in the deposit, classified as upper-crust lead. The ore lead was likely sourced partially from the crustal basement of the Lhasa Terrane. The initial (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) value from five sulfide samples ranged from 0.71732 to 0.72767, and associated ore-forming fluids were mainly sourced from the partial melting of the upper-crust materials. Pb isotopic compositions of ore sulfides from the Dongzhongla deposit are similar to that of the Yuiguila and Mengya'a deposit, indicating that they have similar sources of metal-rich ore-forming solution. According to basic skarn mineralogy, the economic metals, and the origin of the ore-forming fluids, the Dongzhongla deposit was classified as a skarn-type Pb-Zn deposit. Article "

We use opaque mineral assemblages and sulfur isotope geochemistry to reconstruct variations in fluid fluxes, redox conditions and microbial activity prevailing during serpentinization and carbonate precipitation of serpentinites and ophicalcites from an ophiolite sequence in the Northern Apennines (Italy). We then compare our results with calcite-veined serpentinites from the Iberian Margin formed during the opening of the North Atlantic, and with serpentinites sampled at the active peridotite-hosted Lost City hydrothermal field on the Atlantis Massif near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The sulfide and oxide mineral assemblage of the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines is dominated by pyrite, pentlandite, millerite, siegenite, magnetite, and hematite, reflecting relatively oxidizing conditions, while the sulfur geochemistry reveals a dominance of sulfide sulfur over sulfate sulfur. delta S-34 values of sulfide and sulfate indicate that microbial sulfate reduction, leaching, and oxidation are the main processes that affected the sulfur isotope signature of these serpentinites. The opaque mineralogy in the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines is similar to that of the Iberian Margin and the southern wall of the Atlantis Massif, and generally represents the late stages of serpentinization, where intense fluid circulation leads to fairly oxidizing conditions and alkaline fluids lead to carbonate precipitation. However, the mineral assemblages also indicate strong fluctuations in oxygen fugacity, likely caused by volume expansion during serpentinization and tectonic activity along a mid-ocean ridge. Additionally, local enrichment in S-34 in sulfides suggests that fluids interacted at depth with gabbros and subsequently circulated along shear zones, similar to observations along detachment fault surfaces at the Atlantis Massif. Our results, therefore, give further evidence that the ophicalcites and serpentinites from the Northern Apennines formed in a tectonic setting similar to the Atlantis Massif. We estimate a global annual uptake of seawater sulfate of 5.6 to 12 x 10(11) g S by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks exposed to seawater on the ocean floor. We suggest that the thermal structure of the exposed mantle rocks and, in turn, the efficiency of microbes to reduce seawater sulfate to sulfide is a major factor controlling the storage of sulfur in serpentinites. Thus, cycling of sulfur in peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems during the Jurassic was probably very similar to the processes observed today in systems along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
