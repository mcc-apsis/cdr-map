93869,Enhanced chlorophyll associated with tropical instability waves in the equatorial Pacific,"High resolution mooring time series are used to quantify significant chlorophyll anomalies associated with tropical instability waves (TIWs) in the equatorial Pacific. Distinct peaks characterized by very high chlorophyll (up to 3.5 mg m(-3)) are observed in association with TIW cold cusps. These high-chlorophyll peaks appear to differ with respect to scale and intensity from those previously observed at subductive fronts. The physical processes responsible for the observed chlorophyll distributions are not mutually exclusive, and include advection, horizontal mixing; enhanced upwelling and concentration of biomass at fronts. Given the potentially large spatial extent of these high chlorophyll bands, their importance as regions of increased productivity and CO2 uptake is discussed.",,Article,2001.0,,,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Enhanced chlorophyll associated with tropical instability waves in the equatorial Pacific High resolution mooring time series are used to quantify significant chlorophyll anomalies associated with tropical instability waves (TIWs) in the equatorial Pacific.

532139,Relative roles of coastal and oceanic processes in determining physical and chemical characteristics of an intensively sampled nearshore system,"We compared the extent to which offshore and remote-sensing measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), upwelling, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were concordant with in situ measurements of temperature, Chl a, and water nutrients at Tatoosh Island, Washington for the past 8 yr. Offshore SSTs were significantly correlated with water temperatures at Tatoosh, though consistently 2 degrees C to 3 degrees C warmer. Sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor Chl a estimates were poor predictors of Chl a at Tatoosh Island measured with an anchored fluorometer. Nitrate and phosphorus estimates at Tatoosh Island were positively correlated with an upwelling index and negatively correlated with SST, as would be expected from an upwelling source. In contrast, ammonium and nitrite were uncorrelated with the upwelling index or SST and showed elevated levels immediately adjacent to Tatoosh Island, suggesting strong local effects of marine invertebrates, birds, and mammals on nutrient dynamics and cycling in coastal ecosystems.",,Article,2007.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Relative roles of coastal and oceanic processes in determining physical and chemical characteristics of an intensively sampled nearshore system We compared the extent to which offshore and remote-sensing measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), upwelling, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were concordant with in situ measurements of temperature, Chl a, and water nutrients at Tatoosh Island, Washington for the past 8 yr.

5298992,Mesozooplankton responses to iron-fertilization in the western subarctic Pacific (SEEDS2001),"A mesoscale iron-fertilization experiment was carried out in the western subarctic Pacific during summer 2001. The iron-patch was traced for 14 days after the fertilization, and the abundance and behavior of mesozooplankton were compared with those outside of the patch. The phytoplankton biomass in the patch rapidly increased to over 15 times the initial level by the later half of the observation period, and was composed of large-sized (> 10 mm), centric diatoms. Dominant zooplankton species in the upper 200-m depth were large copepods: Neocalanus plumchrus, Neocalanus cristatus, Eucalanus bungii and Metridia pacifica. Mesozoplankton biomass as well as species composition did not change significantly in the patch over the observation period. Furthermore, no changes of vertical distribution or diel vertical migration were observed for any species or stages of mesozooplankton throughout the observation period. However, the abundance of the first copepodite stages of N. plumchrus and E. bungii increased several fold in the patch after the diatom bloom formation compared to the densities outside the patch. The increases of both species are considered to be due to lowered mortality during the egg and nauplius stages. Spawning of N. plumchrus takes place at depth using lipid storage, while spawning of E. bungii takes place in the surface layer supported by grazing. These facts suggest that the relative importance of nauplii in the diets of the large copepods was decreased in the patch by the diatom bloom. Gut-pigment contents of dominant copepods in the patch increased 4-18 times, and the maximum values were observed during the bloom peak. However, the grazing impact on phytoplankton was low throughout the experiment, especially during the bloom period (< 6% of the primary production). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

241637,"Seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, pCO(2), and O-2 in the eastern subarctic Pacific (ocean weather station Papa)","A coupled, one-dimensional ecosystem/carbon flux model is used to simulate the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, O-2, and pCO(2) at ocean weather station Papa (OWS P at 50degreesN, 145degreesW). The 23-year interannual simulation (1958-1980) is validated with available data and analyzed to extend seasonal and interannual variations beyond the limited observational records. The seasonal cycles of pCO(2) and sea-air CO2 flux are controlled by a combination of thermodynamics, winds, and biological uptake. There is ingassing of CO2 during the fall-winter months when SSTs are colder and wind forcing is vigorous, while there is a much smaller ingassing of CO2 during the summer when sea surface temperatures are warmer and wind speeds are reduced. Biological production plays a major role in maintaining the air-sea equilibrium. An abiotic simulation showed that OWS P would be a source of atmospheric CO2 (1.41 mol C m(-2) yr(-1)) if the biological sink of CO2 were removed. The peak net community production in summer compensates for the increased temperature effect on pCO(2), which prevents large outgassing in summer. Oxygen anomalies relative to the temperature-determined saturation value show that there is a seasonal cycle of air-sea flux, with ingassing in winter and outgassing in summer. The net surface oxygen flux is positive (0.8 mol m(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that OWS P is a source of oxygen to the atmosphere. The average primary production is 167 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The 1960-1980 (1958 and 1959 spin-up years removed) mean carbon flux is -1.8 mol C m(-2) yr(-1), indicating that the ocean at OWS P is a sink of atmospheric carbon. The sea-air CO2 flux ranges from -1.2 to -2.3 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) during the 21-year simulation period. This finding emphasizes the need for long-term observations to accurately determine carbon flux budgets. A series of sensitivity experiments indicate that the seasonal variability and overall (21 years) mean of TCO2, pCO(2), DeltapCO(2), and air-sea CO2 flux are strongly dependent on the gas transfer formulation adopted, the total alkalinity near the surface, and the bottom (350 m) value adopted for TCO2. The secular atmospheric pCO(2) upward trend is manifested in the TCO2 concentration within the upper 100 m by an increase of 15 mmol m(-3) in 20 years, consistent with observations at other locations [Winn et al., 1998; Bates, 2001].",,Article,2001.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,241637.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, pCO(2), and O-2 in the eastern subarctic Pacific (ocean weather station Papa) A coupled, one-dimensional ecosystem/carbon flux model is used to simulate the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton, nutrients, TCO2, O-2, and pCO(2) at ocean weather station Papa (OWS P at 50degreesN, 145degreesW).

839650,The influence of environmental variability on the biogeography of coccolithophores and diatoms in the Great Calcite Belt,"The Great Calcite Belt (GCB) of the Southern Ocean is a region of elevated summertime upper ocean calcite concentration derived from coccolithophores, despite the region being known for its diatom predominance. The overlap of two major phytoplankton groups, coccolithophores and diatoms, in the dynamic frontal systems characteristic of this region provides an ideal setting to study environmental influences on the distribution of different species within these taxonomic groups. Samples for phytoplankton enumeration were collected from the upper mixed layer (30 m) during two cruises, the first to the South Atlantic sector (January-February 2011; 60 degrees W-15 degrees E and 36-60 degrees S) and the second in the South Indian sector (February-March 2012; 40-120 degrees E and 36-60 degrees S). The species composition of coccolithophores and diatoms was examined using scanning electron microscopy at 27 stations across the Subtropical, Polar, and Subantarctic fronts. The influence of environmental parameters, such as sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, carbonate chemistry (pH, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon), macronutrients (nitrate + nitrite, phosphate, silicic acid, ammonia), and mixed layer average irradiance, on species composition across the GCB was assessed statistically. Nanophytoplankton (cells 2-20 mu m) were the numerically abundant size group of biomineralizing phytoplankton across the GCB, with the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi and diatoms Fragilariopsis nana, F. pseudonana, and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. as the most numerically dominant and widely distributed. A combination of SST, macronutrient concentrations, and pCO(2) provided the best statistical descriptors of the biogeographic variability in biomineralizing species composition between stations. Emiliania huxleyi occurred in silicic acid-depleted waters between the Subantarctic Front and the Polar Front, a favorable environment for this species after spring diatom blooms remove silicic acid.

796640,Controlling mechanisms of surface partial pressure of CO2 in Jiaozhou Bay during summer and the influence of heavy rain,"Due to the combined effects of natural processes and human activities, carbon source/sink processes and mechanisms in the coastal ocean are becoming more and more important in current ocean carbon cycle research. Based on differences in the ratio of total alkalinity (TA) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) associated with terrestrial input, biological process (production and respiration), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) process (precipitation and dissolution) and CO2 evasion/invasion, we discuss the mechanisms controlling the surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB) during summer and the influence of heavy rain, via three cruises performed in mid-June, early July and late July of 2014. In mid-June and in early July, without heavy rain or obvious river input, sea surface pCO(2) ranged from 521 to 1080 atm and from 547 to 998 atm, respectively. The direct input of DIC from sewage and the intense respiration produced large DIC additions and the highest pCO(2) values in the northeast of the bay near the downtown of Qingdao. However, in the west of the bay, significant CaCO3 precipitation led to DIC removal but no obvious increase in pCO(2), which was just close to that in the central area. Due to the shallow depth and longer water residence time in this region, this pattern may be related to the sustained release of CO2 into the atmosphere. In late July, heavy rain promoted river input in the western and eastern portions of JZB. Strong primary production led to a significant decrease in pCO(2) in the western area, with the lowest pCO(2) value of 252 atm. However, in the northeastern area, the intense respiration remained, and the highest pCO(2) value was 1149 atm. The average air-sea CO2 flux in mid-June and early July was 20.23 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and 23.56 mmol m(-2) d-1, respectively. In contrast, in late July, sources became sinks for atmospheric CO2 in the western and central areas of the bay, halving the average air-sea CO2 flux to a value of 10.58 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Therefore, without considering the impact of heavy rains, the estimated air-sea CO2 flux is likely inaccurate in coastal waters. Our study implies that more studies in the coastal ocean are needed to determine the duration and intensity of the CO2 sink after the occurrence of heavy rain as well as the magnitudes of the CO2 sink associated with varying rainfall intensities.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

713692,Iron fertilisation and century-scale effects of open ocean dissolution of olivine in a simulated CO2 removal experiment,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) approaches are efforts to reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here we use a marine carbon cycle model to investigate the effects of one CDR technique: the open ocean dissolution of the iron-containing mineral olivine. We analyse the maximum CDR potential of an annual dissolution of 3 Pg olivine during the 21st century and focus on the role of the micronutrient iron for the biological carbon pump. Distributing the products of olivine dissolution (bicarbonate, silicic acid, iron) uniformly in the global surface ocean has a maximum CDR potential of 0.57. gC/g-olivine mainly due to the alkalinisation of the ocean, with a significant contribution from the fertilisation of phytoplankton with silicic acid and iron. The part of the CDR caused by ocean fertilisation is not permanent, while the CO2 sequestered by alkalinisation would be stored in the ocean as long as alkalinity is not removed from the system. For high CO2 emission scenarios the CDR potential due to the alkalinity input becomes more efficient over time with increasing ocean acidification. The alkalinity-induced CDR potential scales linearly with the amount of olivine, while the iron-induced CDR saturates at 113 PgC per century (on average similar to 1.1 PgC. yr(-1)) for an iron input rate of 2.3.

1405887,Characterization of airborne carbonate over a site near Asian dust source regions during spring 2002 and its climatic and environmental significance,"[1] During spring 2002, three dust storm events were monitored by filter sampling in Xi'an near an Asian dust source region of northwest China. The carbonate (CO32-) fraction was determined by sample acidification and thermal evolution. The CO32- accounted for 8.0 +/- 0.8% of particles with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to2.5 mm (PM2.5) during dust storms and 4.7 +/- 3.0% of PM2.5 between storms. The ratios of calcium to carbonate carbon were consistent with those of calcite (CaCO3). The delta(13)C and delta(18)O abundances in dust storm samples were -2.7 +/- 0.7parts per thousand and -5.8 +/- 1.5parts per thousand, which differed from -8.3 +/- 1.9parts per thousand for delta(13)C and -10.8 +/- 2.0parts per thousand for delta(18)O during normal conditions.

156602,Geoengineering potential of artificially enhanced silicate weathering of olivine,"Geoengineering is a proposed action to manipulate Earth's climate in order to counteract global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into consideration, a new mass ratio of CO2 sequestration per olivine dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20% smaller than previously assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid.

We investigate the potential of a specific geoengineering technique, carbon sequestration by artificially enhanced silicate weathering via the dissolution of olivine. This approach would not only operate against rising temperatures but would also oppose ocean acidification, because it influences the global climate via the carbon cycle. If important details of the marine chemistry are taken into consideration, a new mass ratio of CO2 sequestration per olivine dissolution of about 1 is achieved, 20% smaller than previously assumed. We calculate that this approach has the potential to sequestrate up to 1 Pg of C per year directly, if olivine is distributed as fine powder over land areas of the humid tropics, but this rate is limited by the saturation concentration of silicic acid.

4376501,"Variability and stability of anthropogenic CO2 in Antarctic Bottom Water observed in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean, 1978-2018","Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is known as a long-term sink for anthropogenic CO2 (C-ant), but the sink is hardly quantified because of the scarcity of observations, specifically at an interannual scale. We present in this paper an original dataset combining 40 years of carbonate system observations in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (Enderby Basin) to evaluate and interpret the interannual variability of C-ant in the AABW. This investigation is based on regular observations collected at the same location (63 degrees E-56.5 degrees S) in the framework of the French observatory OISO from 1998 to 2018 extended by GEOSECS and INDIGO observations (1978, 1985 and 1987). At this location the main sources of AABW sampled is the low-salinity Cape Darnley Bottom Water (CDBW) and the Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). Our calculations reveal that C ant concentrations increased significantly in the AABW, from an average concentration of 7 mu mol kg(-1) calculated for the period 1978-1987 to an average concentration of 13 mu mol kg(-1) for the period 2010-2018. This is comparable to previous estimates in other Southern Ocean (SO) basins, with the exception of bottom water close to formation sites where C-ant concentrations are about twice as large. Our analysis shows that total carbon (C-T) and C ant increasing rates in the AABW are about the same over the period 1978-2018, and we conclude that the long-term change in C-T is mainly due to the uptake of C-ant in the different formation regions. This is, however, modulated by significant interannual to multi-annual variability associated with variations in hydrographic (potential temperature, Theta salinity, S) and bio-geochemical (C-T; total alkalinity, AT; dissolved oxygen, O-2) properties. A surprising result is the apparent stability of C-ant concentrations in recent years despite the increase in C-T and the gradual acceleration of atmospheric CO2.

231335,Life cycle greenhouse gas assessment of a coal-fired power station with calcium looping CO2 capture and offshore geological storage,"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an essential technology for reducing global CO2 emissions in the context of continued fossil fuel use in the power sector. To evaluate the emission reduction potential of any low-carbon generation technology it is necessary to consider emissions over the entire lifetime of the plant. This work examines the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of a 500 MWe pulverised coal-fired power plant with post-combustion Calcium Looping (CaL) and off-shore geological storage. CaL uses solid CO2-sorbent derived from abundant and non-toxic limestone (CaCO3) and is currently being piloted at the 1-2 MWth scale in Europe (Spain and Germany). This technology promises to be very competitive with the more mature chemical absorption processes, with the potential to reduce the efficiency and cost penalties of CO2 capture. We demonstrate that the emission intensity of a coal-fired power plant with CaL is at least comparable with one using MEA-solvent technology (i.e., similar to 229 gCO(2)e/kWh vs. 225 gCO(2)e/kWh). However, there is significant potential for additional emissions reduction when considering the recarbonation of exhausted sorbent in landfill. Furthermore, a coal-fired power plant with CaL could be carbon-neutral - or even achieve a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.

724896,"Reactions between basalt and CO2-rich seawater at 250 and 350 degrees C, 500 bars: Implications for the CO2 sequestration into the modern oceanic crust and the composition of hydrothermal vent fluid in the CO2-rich early ocean","This study aims to understand how basaltic rocks absorb CO2 in high-temperature alteration zones in the subseafloor, and to reconstruct hydrothermal alteration processes such as carbonatization of Archean greenstones. To this end, we conducted two laboratory experiments, simulating hydrothermal reactions between basalt (synthesized under quartz-fayalite-magnetite oxygen fugacity) and CO2-rich NaCl fluid (pH = 6.5 at 25 degrees C) at high temperature and pressure. As the water/rock reactions progressed at 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C, 500 bars, total carbonic acid concentration (Sigma CO2) reduced from its initial 400 mmol/kg to near 0 and 100 mmol/kg, respectively, meanwhile calcite was formed in the basalt as an alteration mineral. This indicates that calcite destabilizes as temperature increases in the H2O-CO2-basalt system and that crustal basalts can absorb almost all CO2 in the fluid as calcite, at least at temperatures and initial CO2 concentrations below 250 degrees C and 400 mmol/kg, respectively. Although the second aim was realized in the experiments, minerals such as sericite, dolomite, ankerite, and siderite present in Archean greenstones were not identified in the alteration products, possibly because K, Mg, and Fe were lacking in the initial solutions. Steady-state concentrations of SiO2, Mg, and K in the fluids during water/rock reactions were similar to those of high-temperature fluids (>250 degrees C) in modern basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems. However, the final experimental pH(in-situ) was 6.6 and 7.2 at 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C, respectively, higher than that in modern hydrothermal fluids (approximately 5) and higher than the neutral pH (5.5-5.6) at 250-350 degrees C, 500 bars. The results suggest that the presence of abundant CO2 in the initial fluid induced carbonatization of basalt; consequently, pH was buffered by precipitation and dissolution of calcite. Because pH(in-situ) was elevated, the dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations in the fluid were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those of modern hydrothermal fluids. In modern oceans, high-temperature hydrothermal vent fluids are the second-largest iron source (after riverine input).

671620,Contribution of iron to the energetics of CO2 sequestration in Mg-silicates-based rock,"The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the contribution of iron to the energy requirements of a process for producing magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)(2)) from alkaline-earth Mg-silicate rock that contains iron, such as serpentinite. Once produced Mg(OH)(2) could be used to sequester carbon either by direct mineralization at a power plant or from the air, or as a means to deliver alkalinity to the ocean thus tending to restore oceanic pH and sequester atmospheric carbon. Fe-containing by-products obtained from producing Mg(OH)(2) are considered to be beneficial as secondary raw materials for iron-and steel-making industries. It has been proposed that this could further reduce CO2 emissions as well as raw material costs. However, this study hypothesized that the extent of this benefit, if any, would depend on energy intensity of reactions involving iron compounds. Using Aspen Plus (R) software, the contribution of iron to the energy input requirement of CO2 sequestration was modeled. Results obtained showed that the extraction of iron from Mg-silicate minerals could present a significant energy penalty to the mineralization process. Exergy analysis shows that at the experimental optimal temperature of 400 degrees C, the energy penalties of having iron oxide (FeO), hematite (Fe2O3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) as dominant iron compounds results are (for 10 wt.% Fe in the rock) an increase of 0.3 GJ/t CO2 (7%), 0.7 GJ/t CO2 (20%) and 2.2 GJ/t CO2 (60%) respectively when compared to an iron-free base case. Recovery of input raw material, ammonium sulfate (AS) by evaporative crystallization is a major energy intensive step in this process. However, our model applied mechanical vapor recompression (MVR), which resulted in a significant reduction in energy demand. It can be concluded that the benefit of producing useful Fe by-products comes with an energy penalty, the extent of which varies with the form of Fe compound in the mineral. The findings in this paper are useful in determining which Mg-silicate-based rocks would be energy efficient for use. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

160631,Drivers of the carbonate system seasonal variations in a Mediterranean gulf,"The effects of different physical and biogeochemical drivers on the carbonate system were investigated in a semi-enclosed coastal area characterized by high alkalinity riverine discharge (Gulf of Trieste, Northern Adriatic Sea, Mediterranean Sea). Our 2-year time-series showed that a large part of the seasonal carbonate chemistry variation was controlled by the large seasonal change of seawater temperature, though air-sea CO2 exchange, biological activity (primary production-respiration), and riverine inputs also exerted a significant influence. With the exception of summer, the Gulf of Trieste was a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide, showing a very strong CO2 fluxes from atmosphere into the sea (-16.10 mmol m(-2) day(-1)) during high wind speed event of north easterly Bora wind. The CO2 influx was particularly evident in winter, when the biological activity was at minimum and the low seawater temperature enhanced CO2 solubility. During spring, the drawdown of CO2 by primary production overwhelmed the CO2 physical pump, driving a significant decrease of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), [CO2], and increase of pH(T25) (degrees C). In summer the primary production in surface waters occurred with the same intensity as respiration in the bottom layer, so the net biological effect on the carbonate system was very low and the further reduction of seawater CO2 concentration observed was mainly due to carbon dioxide degassing induced by high seawater temperature. Finally, during autumn the respiration was the predominant process, which determined an overall increase of DIC, [CO2], and decrease of pH(T25) (degrees C). This was particularly evident when the breakdown of summer stratification occurred and a large amount of CO2, generated by respiration and segregated below the pycnocline, was released back to the whole water column. Local rivers also significantly affected the carbonate system by direct input of total alkalinity (A(T)) coming from the chemical weathering of carbonate rocks, which dominate the river watershed. Our finding clearly demonstrates a high A(T) concentration in low salinity surface waters (A(T) max = 2742.8 mu mol kg(-1)) and a negative A(T)-salinity correlation.

46963,The role of carbonates in the evolution of early martian oceans,"Central to the question of Life on Mars is whether there has been liquid water on the martian surface and how the planet could have evolved from possible initial warm and wet conditions to the cold and dry present state. Virtually all models for this climatic evolution rely strongly on the removal of an initial thick carbon dioxide atmosphere by precipitation of carbonate minerals from surface waters that may have been quite similar to those of Hadean Eon Earth's oceans. In order for this to occur, a hydrologic cycle would be necessary in which chemical weathering of silicate rocks consumes CO2 that precipitates as carbonates in an acidic martian ocean which probably had a very high alkalinity. The consumption of atmospheric CO2 by this process would result in a gradual decrease of the atmospheric greenhouse influence and cooling of the climate. Once the surface of Mars became cold enough so that freezing conditions prevailed the hydrologic cycle would largely cease, and the uptake of CO2 by silicate rock weathering would greatly diminish. The alkalinity of the freezing seawater would probably be sufficient to result in the removal of all calcium as calcium carbonate.

The formation, composition and physical properties of steel making slag are discussed with regard to the problems associated with its reuse.

733032,Anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the South Atlantic western basin,"The meridional WOCE line A17 was conducted during the austral summer of 1994 parallel to the eastern South American coast, from 55 degrees S to 10 degrees S, where one of the main limbs of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). i.e., the southward-flowing Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) is found. Full-depth profiles of pH, total alkalinity and total inorganic carbon were measured and checked with analytical CO2 certified reference materials (CRMs), providing a high-quality dataset with good internal consistency for the CO2 system parameters that is well suited for anthropogenic CO2 (C-ANT) estimation. For the first time in the western Atlantic basin the C-ANT has been calculated using four independent approaches and results are compared. The methods considered are the CFC-based TTD method and the (phi C-T degrees TrOCA and Delta C* carbon system-based back-calculation methods. All four methods have produced C-ANT distribution patterns that are in general good agreement: maximum concentrations of C-ANT (50-60 mu mol kg(-1)) are predicted for the upper warm South Atlantic central waters from the tropical gyres, while the minima (similar to 5 mu mol kg(-1)) are located in the old northward-flowing branch of Circumpolar Deep Water. There are, however, some discrepancies detected. The TrOCA method yields the highest overall [C-ANT] values, even over the theoretical limit of C-ANT saturation for 1994 in the upper layers. The Delta C* approach consistently yielded negative estimates of C-ANT below 2800 dbar, even after correcting a reported - 8 mu mol kg(-1) bias in the alkalinity measurements of the WOCE A17 line. The main overall difference between the four methods corresponds to the relative C-ANT maximum associated with the lower limb of NADW: this structure is well identified in the phi C-T degrees and TTD methods but seems to disappear in the case of TrOCA and Delta C*. In agreement with other intercomparison studies of C-ANT, the specific inventories are significantly higher (similar to 45%) than those reported in the GLODAP database obtained from the Delta C*. method. This suggests that the South Atlantic stores more C-ANT than initially expected, particularly towards the southernmost tip of the WOCE A17 line, close to the Southern Ocean. The phi C-T degrees, TrOCA and TTD methods confirm an increasing tendency of C-ANT specific inventories south from the Equator, while the Delta C* method shows a decreasing trend south from 35 degrees S.

694107,Weddell Sea turned from source to sink for atmospheric CO2 between pre-industrial time and present,"Using contemporary CO2 data from the subsurface Weddell Sea, the source/sink function of this region against the changing atmospheric CO2 level has been investigated. As in the central Weddell Sea, surface water is supplied by upwelling of subsurface water, the CO2 content is also forced by it. TCO2 data of four cruises were used to determine a robust value for the subsurface Warm Deep Water (WDW). After accounting for biological activity in the surface layer and salinity differences between the subsurface and surface waters, the forcing CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) was calculated from the TCO2 of the WDW and the conservative alkalinity as taken from the literature. As the WDW contains negligible anthropogenic CO2, the pCO(2) forcing by the WDW has been prevalent both in the pre-industrial and modem Weddell Sea. The calculated pCO(2) forcing amounts to 300-310 muatm at a minimum in late winter/early spring and possibly 30 muatm more during spring and summer. This figure does not represent the actual pCO(2), but rather the value before air-sea exchange gets effective. Hence, in pre-industrial times when the atmospheric pCO(2) was about 280 muatm, the Weddell Sea must have been a relatively strong source of atmospheric CO2. Because of the steadily rising atmospheric CO2 levels to more than the pCO(2) forcing by the WDW, the Weddell Sea turned into a CO, sink in recent times. The storage of anthropogenic CO2 in the Weddell Sea surface layer is estimated to be 4.1 Mol C m(-2). Applying the WDW forcing method to O-2, a steady state O-2 uptake from the atmosphere of 3.6 mol O-2 m(-2) year(-1) is computed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

229206,Annual cycle and interannual variability of ecosystem metabolism in a temperate climate embayment,"We have studied the net and gross metabolism of Tomales Bay, a temperate climate estuary in northern California. Tomales Bay has proved to be heterotrophic, implying that the bay oxidizes a subsidy of organic carbon from outside the system, in excess of inorganic nutrients supplied to it from outside and in addition to material cycling within it. Net organic oxidation releases dissolved inorganic nutrients, and the system exports these dissolved inorganic products. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus is exported to the ocean via mixing and constitutes the most direct record of net ecosystem production (NEP). Excess dissolved inorganic nitrogen is lost to denitrification. Excess dissolved inorganic carbon largely results in alkalinity elevation and hydrographic export of alkalinity due to sulfate reduction. The negative NEP of this system results in little release of CO2 to the atmosphere, because of this alkalinity elevation. A major purpose of the study was to ascertain the relative importance of various sources of organic material supplied to the system from outside its boundaries and undergoing net reactions within it. In order to address the question, we used stoichiometrically linked whole-system budgets of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The difference between dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) fluxes to and from the bay is a measure of net internal sources or sinks of DIP and is used as a quantitative index of NEP, with the assumption that the C:P ratio of organic matter is constant (similar to 106:1). The system is thus defined in terms of water column dissolved material composition; this definition includes time, as well as space. Net changes in the standing stocks of dissolved materials can originate from (spatial) transport to or from the system or from internal (temporal) transformations between the dissolved and particulate materials (i.e., changes in organic storage). Over the 8-yr study, the system respired 12 mmol.m(-2).d(-1) more organic C than the internal system primary production of similar to 100 mmol.m(-2)d(-1). The system is thus heterotrophic by similar to 10%, with substantial seasonality in the extent of heterotrophy. By deconvoluting the time series of NEP into a seasonal cycle and interannual variation, we infer that terrestrial and marine sources each account for about half of the carbon required to support negative NEP in this system, but with quite different turnover time scales. Temporal response of NEP to terrigenous input appears to be extremely modulated, so that there is no obvious immediate (same year) response to extreme interannual variation in terrigenous organic loading. In contrast, NEP responds both interannually and seasonally to marine organic inputs. We interpret the differences in response to loading of terrestrial vs. marine organic matter as reflecting differences in the reactivity of these carbon reservoirs.",annual cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon; ecosystem metabolism; embayment; interannual variability; net ecosystem production; nitrogen; phosphorus; runoff; stoichiometry; upwelling,Article,1997.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,229206.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Annual cycle and interannual variability of ecosystem metabolism in a temperate climate embayment annual cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon; ecosystem metabolism; embayment; interannual variability; net ecosystem production; nitrogen; phosphorus; runoff; stoichiometry; upwelling We have studied the net and gross metabolism of Tomales Bay, a temperate climate estuary in northern California.

564048,Carbon dynamics and community production in the Mississippi River plume,"Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TAlk), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were determined in the Mississippi River plume during five cruises conducted in the spring, summer, and fall. In contrast to many other large rivers, both DIC and TAlk were higher in river water than in seawater. Substantial losses of DIC, relative to TAlk, occurred within the plume, particularly at intermediate salinities. DIC removal was accompanied by high DO, high pH, and nutrient depletion, and was attributed to high phytoplankton production. As a result, the carbonate saturation in the plume became much higher than in ocean and river waters. A mixing model was used to determine DIC removal. We provide evidence that the use of a two-end-member (river and ocean) mixing model was valid during late summer and fall (low discharge period). However, for other periods we used salinity and TAlk to delineate a mixing model that included two river end members and an ocean end member. Net community production rates in the plume, estimated using a box model, peaked in the summer and were among the highest reported to date for large river plumes. In the summer and fall, biological production in the river plume consumed a majority of the available nutrients, whereas during the spring only a small fraction of the available nutrients were consumed in the plume.

335679,Electrochemical acceleration of chemical weathering as an energetically feasible approach to mitigating anthropogenic climate change,"We describe an approach to CO2 capture and storage from the atmosphere that involves enhancing the solubility of CO2 in the ocean by a process equivalent to the natural silicate weathering reaction. HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3- without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit-and with the appropriate silicate rocks-the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100-400 kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of population centers. It may also be useful on a regional scale for protection of coral reefs from further ocean acidification. Application of this technology may involve neutralizing the alkaline solution that is coproduced with HCl with CO2 from a point source or from the atmosphere prior to being returned to the ocean.",,Article,2007.0,1.0,,,,,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,335679.0,0 - relevant,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,1,1,1,1,"Electrochemical acceleration of chemical weathering as an energetically feasible approach to mitigating anthropogenic climate change We describe an approach to CO2 capture and storage from the atmosphere that involves enhancing the solubility of CO2 in the ocean by a process equivalent to the natural silicate weathering reaction.

377650,The role of forest trees and their mycorrhizal fungi in carbonate rock weathering and its significance for global carbon cycling,"On million-year timescales, carbonate rock weathering exerts no net effect on atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, on timescales of decades-to-centuries, it can contribute to sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 and increase land-ocean alkalinity flux, counteracting ocean acidification. Historical evidence indicates this flux is sensitive to land use change, and recent experimental evidence suggests that trees and their associated soil microbial communities are major drivers of continental mineral weathering. Here, we review key physical and chemical mechanisms by which the symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi of forest tree roots potentially enhance carbonate rock weathering. Evidence from our ongoing field study at the UK's national pinetum confirms increased weathering of carbonate rocks by a wide range of gymnosperm and angiosperm tree species that form arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal partnerships. We demonstrate that calcite-containing rock grains under EM tree species weather significantly faster than those under AM trees, an effect linked to greater soil acidification by EM trees. Weathering and corresponding alkalinity export are likely to increase with rising atmospheric CO2 and associated climate change. Our analyses suggest that strategic planting of fast-growing EM angiosperm taxa on calcite- and dolomite-rich terrain might accelerate the transient sink for atmospheric CO2 and slow rates of ocean acidification. Carbonate mineral weathering in forest soils could act as a transient sink for anthropogenic CO (2) over human timescales of decades to centuries.

207657,"Dramatic Variability of the Carbonate System at a Temperate Coastal Ocean Site (Beaufort, North Carolina, USA) Is Regulated by Physical and Biogeochemical Processes on Multiple Timescales","Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from anthropogenic sources is acidifying marine environments resulting in potentially dramatic consequences for the physical, chemical and biological functioning of these ecosystems. If current trends continue, mean ocean pH is expected to decrease by similar to 0.2 units over the next similar to 50 years. Yet, there is also substantial temporal variability in pH and other carbon system parameters in the ocean resulting in regions that already experience change that exceeds long-term projected trends in pH. This points to short-term dynamics as an important layer of complexity on top of long-term trends. Thus, in order to predict future climate change impacts, there is a critical need to characterize the natural range and dynamics of the marine carbonate system and the mechanisms responsible for observed variability. Here, we present pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at time intervals spanning 1 hour to >1 year from a dynamic, coastal, temperate marine system (Beaufort Inlet, Beaufort NC USA) to characterize the carbonate system at multiple time scales. Daily and seasonal variation of the carbonate system is largely driven by temperature, alkalinity and the balance between primary production and respiration, but high frequency change (hours to days) is further influenced by water mass movement (e. g. tides) and stochastic events (e. g. storms). Both annual (similar to 0.3 units) and diurnal (similar to 0.1 units) variability in coastal ocean acidity are similar in magnitude to 50 year projections of ocean acidity associated with increasing atmospheric CO2. The environmental variables driving these changes highlight the importance of characterizing the complete carbonate system rather than just pH.

923431,Quantifying and Comparing Effects of Climate Engineering Methods on the Earth System,"To contribute to a quantitative comparison of climate engineering (CE) methods, we assess atmosphere-, ocean-, and land-based CE measures with respect to Earth system effects consistently within one comprehensive model. We use the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) with prognostic carbon cycle to compare solar radiation management (SRM) by stratospheric sulfur injection and two carbon dioxide removal methods: afforestation and ocean alkalinization. The CE model experiments are designed to offset the effect of fossil-fuel burning on global mean surface air temperature under the RCP8.5 scenario to follow or get closer to the RCP4.5 scenario. Our results show the importance of feedbacks in the CE effects. For example, as a response to SRM the land carbon uptake is enhanced by 92Gt by the year 2100 compared to the reference RCP8.5 scenario due to reduced soil respiration thus reducing atmospheric CO2. Furthermore, we show that normalizations allow for a better comparability of different CE methods. For example, we find that due to compensating processes such as biogeophysical effects of afforestation more carbon needs to be removed from the atmosphere by afforestation than by alkalinization to reach the same global warming reduction. Overall, we illustrate how different CE methods affect the components of the Earth system; we identify challenges arising in a CE comparison, and thereby contribute to developing a framework for a comparative assessment of CE.",climate engineering; geoengineering; solar radiation management; carbon dioxide removal; Earth system modelling; carbon cycle,Article,2018.0,1.0,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,923431.0,0 - relevant,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,1,1,1,1,"Quantifying and Comparing Effects of Climate Engineering Methods on the Earth System climate engineering; geoengineering; solar radiation management; carbon dioxide removal; Earth system modelling; carbon cycle To contribute to a quantitative comparison of climate engineering (CE) methods, we assess atmosphere-, ocean-, and land-based CE measures with respect to Earth system effects consistently within one comprehensive model.

719635,"Air-sea CO2 exchange in a subtropical estuarine-coral reef system, Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii","The present study represents the first time-series evaluation of air-sea CO2 exchange for a coastal marine system of a subtropical high island of the Pacific. From September 2003 through September 2004, surface water total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) data were collected bimonthly. throughout the Kaneohe Bay estuarine-coral reef system. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and the air-sea CO2 exchange flux were calculated using TA, DIC, atmospheric CO2 at sea level, and five wind speed relationships for gas transfer velocity. pCO(2) values were above the atmospheric level (average: 378 mu atm) throughout Kaneohe Bay (400-500 mu atm) and Kaneohe Stream waters (600-1300 mu atm) during baseline conditions. pCO(2) levels above atmospheric in bay water were driven mainly by calcification while pCO(2) levels above atmospheric in stream water were driven mainly by remineralization of terrestrial organic matter. pCO(2) values above the atmospheric level were observed in surface water that extended almost 4 kin beyond the boundary of the bay indicating that processes inside the bay such as calcification affect the inorganic carbon properties of the surrounding near shore open ocean. Precipitation from storm events in the Kaneohe watershed increases stream and land runoff that brings excess nutrients to bay waters. These excess nutrients stimulate phytoplankton blooms which draw down CO2 in Kaneohe Bay water through photosynthesis. Despite the significant effects of the storms, Kaneohe Bay was a net annual source of CO2 to the atmosphere of -0.046 Gmol C year(-1) (-0.55 kton C year(-1)) with an area-specific flux of -1.45 mol C m(-2) year(-1) (-17.4 g C m(-2) year(-1)).

852733,Negative emissions-Part 1: Research landscape and synthesis,"With the Paris Agreement's ambition of limiting climate change to well below 2 degrees C, negative emission technologies (NETs) have moved into the limelight of discussions in climate science and policy. Despite several assessments, the current knowledge on NETs is still diffuse and incomplete, but also growing fast. Here, we synthesize a comprehensive body of NETs literature, using scientometric tools and performing an in-depth assessment of the quantitative and qualitative evidence therein. We clarify the role of NETs in climate change mitigation scenarios, their ethical implications, as well as the challenges involved in bringing the various NETs to the market and scaling them up in time. There are six major findings arising from our assessment: first, keeping warming below 1.5 degrees C requires the large-scale deployment of NETs, but this dependency can still be kept to a minimum for the 2 degrees C warming limit. Second, accounting for economic and biophysical limits, we identify relevant potentials for all NETs except ocean fertilization. Third, any single NET is unlikely to sustainably achieve the large NETs deployment observed in many 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C mitigation scenarios. Yet, portfolios of multiple NETs, each deployed at modest scales, could be invaluable for reaching the climate goals. Fourth, a substantial gap exists between the upscaling and rapid diffusion of NETs implied in scenarios and progress in actual innovation and deployment. If NETs are required at the scales currently discussed, the resulting urgency of implementation is currently neither reflected in science nor policy.

5298924,Mesozoic mafic alkaline magmatism of southern Scandinavia,"More than 100 volcanic necks in central Scania (southern Sweden) are the product of Jurassic continental rift-related mafic alkaline magmatism at the southwest margin of the Baltic Shield. They are mainly basanites, with rarer melanephelinites. Both rock groups display overlapping primitive Mg-numbers, Cr and Ni contents, steep chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns (La-N /Yb-N = 17-27) and an overall enrichment in incompatible elements. However, the melanephelinites are more alkaline and have stronger high field strength element enrichment than the basanites. The existence of distinct primary magmas is also indicated by heterogeneity in highly incompatible element ratios (e.g. Zr/Nb, La/Nb). Trace element modelling indicates that the magmas were generated by comparably low degrees of melting of a heterogeneous mantle source. Such a source can best be explained by a metasomatic overprint of the mantle lithosphere by percolating evolved melts. The former existence of such alkaline trace element-enriched melts can be demonstrated by inversion of the trace element content of green-core clinopyroxenes and anorthoclase which occur as xenocrysts in the melanephelinites and are interpreted as being derived from crystallization of evolved mantle melts. Jurassic magmatic activity in Scania was coeval with the generation of nephelinites in the nearby Egersund Basin (Norwegian North Sea). Both Scanian and North Sea alkaline magmas share similar trace element characteristics. Mantle enrichment processes at the southwest margin of the Baltic Shield and the North Sea Basin generated trace element signatures similar to those of ocean island basalts (e.g. low Zr/Nb and La/Nb) but there are no indications of plume activity during the Mesozoic in this area. On the contrary, the short duration of rifting, absence of extensive lithospheric thinning, and low magma volumes argue against a Mesozoic mantle plume. It seems likely that the metasomatic imprint resulted from the earlier Permo-Carboniferous rifting episode which affected the entire study area and clearly was accompanied by plume activity (Ernst and Buchan in American Geophysical Union, pp 297-337, 1997).

1847020,Inorganic carbon parameters responding to summer hypoxia outside the Changjiang Estuary and the related implications,"The eutrophication, hypoxia and coastal acidification are attracting more and more attention. In this study, inorganic carbon parameters, including dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA) and calculated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), obtained from a summer cruise in August, 2009, were used to investigate their integrated response to biological processes accompanying the oxygen depletion in the areas off the Changjiang Estuary. According to the observations, the typical hypoxia occurred in the bottom water just outside the Changjiang Estuary with Dissolved Oxygen (DO) lower than 2.00 mg L-1. The biological uptake in the surface water and the decomposition of organic matter in the bottom water were fully coupled with each other. The high concentration of Chl_a (Chl_a = 10.9 mu g L-1) and DO (9.25 mg L-1), profoundly decreased DIC concentration (1828 mu mol kg(-1)) and elevated pH (8.42) was observed in the surface water. The correspondingly increased DIC and depletion of oxygen were observed in the bottom water. The semi-quantitative analysis proved that the locally-produced phytoplankton, determined by primary productivity, was deposited to the bottom and contributed about 76% of total amount of the organic carbon decomposition in the bottom. However, in the bottom hypoxia (DO = 2.05 mg L-1) area observed in the Southern Zhejiang coastal water, the responding patterns of inorganic carbon parameters deviated from the previous one.

5298923,"The evolution of stable silicon isotopes in a coastal carbonate aquifer on Rottnest Island, Western Australia","Dissolved silicon (dSi) is a key nutrient in the oceans, but data regarding Si isotopes in coastal aquifers are not widely available. Here we investigate the Si isotopic composition of 12 fresh and 16 saline groundwater samples from Rottnest Island, Western Australia, which forms part of the world's most extensive aeolianite deposit (the Tamala Limestone formation). In total, two bedrock samples were also collected from Rottnest Island for Si isotope analysis. The delta Si-30 values of groundwater samples ranged from -0.4% to +3.6% with an average +1.6 %, and the rock samples were -0.8% and -0.1 %. The increase in delta Si-30 values in fresh groundwater is attributed to the removal of the lighter Si isotopes into secondary minerals and potentially also adsorption onto Fe (oxy)hydroxides. The positive correlations between delta Si-30 values and dSi concentrations (rho = 0.59; p = 0.02) and delta Si-30 values and Cl, but not dSi and Cl concentrations, are consistent with vertical mixing between the younger fresh groundwater and the deeper groundwater, which have undergone a greater degree of water-rock interactions.

843494,Is the response of coral calcification to seawater acidification related to nutrient loading?,"The effect of decreasing aragonite saturation state (Omega(Arag)) of seawater (elevated pCO(2)) on calcification rates of Acropora muricata was studied using nubbins prepared from parent colonies located at two sites of La Saline reef (La R,union Island, western Indian Ocean): a back-reef site (BR) affected by nutrient-enriched groundwater discharge (mainly nitrate), and a reef flat site (RF) with low terrigenous inputs. Protein and chlorophyll a content of the nubbins, as well as zooxanthellae abundance, were lower at RF than BR. Nubbins were incubated at similar to 27A degrees C over 2 h under sunlight, in filtered seawater manipulated to get differing initial pCO(2) (1,440-340 mu atm), Omega(Arag) (1.4-4.0), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations (2,100-1,850 mu mol kg(-1)). Increasing DIC concentrations at constant total alkalinity (A(T)) resulted in a decrease in Omega(Arag) and an increase in pCO(2). A(T) at the beginning of the incubations was kept at a natural level of 2,193 +/- A 6 mu mol kg(-1) (mean +/- A SD). Net photosynthesis (NP) and calcification were calculated from changes in pH and A(T) during the incubations. Calcification decrease in response to doubling pCO(2) relative to preindustrial level was 22% for RF nubbins. When normalized to surface area of the nubbins, (1) NP and calcification were higher at BR than RF, (2) NP increased in high pCO(2) treatments at BR compared to low pCO(2) treatments, and (3) calcification was not related to Omega(Arag) at BR.

5298917,Seasonal cycles of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon at high and mid latitudes in the North Pacific Ocean during the Skaugran cruises: determination of new production and nutrient uptake ratios,"The results of a 2-yr monitoring program in the North Pacific (March 1995-April 1997) using the commercial cargo carrier M/V Skaugran are presented in this paper. Seasonal changes in macronutrients (nitrate, phosphate and silicate), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) were recorded in the surface waters of 12 major provinces of the North Pacific Ocean (35-55degreesN). North of the subarctic boundary (40degreesN), nitrate rarely decreased to below detection limit except in the more near-shore provinces, with nitrate concentrations remaining as high as 8-9 mumol kg(-1) in the summer in the northern provinces of the Bering Sea, the central and western subarctic Pacific. There were also strong latitudinal nutrient gradients. In most provinces of the subarctic Pacific, there was little interannual change in the nutrient cycles, except in the western subarctic Pacific where nitrate concentration fell to 2.6 pmol kg(-1) in the summer of 1996. We suggest that this large nitrate depletion was due to enhanced diatom production triggered by the supply of iron from the Asian continent. The relationship between salinity-normalized TA and DIC revealed that calcification was low or negligible in the surface waters of the Bering Sea and the western subarctic Pacific. In contrast, the percent of CaCO(3) production to organic carbon production was found to be at times as high as 70-75% in the eastern subarctic Pacific and the southern region off east Japan. This study also revealed east-west contrasts in the seasonal nutrient-depletion ratios. In the east, the elevated DIC:NO(3) ratios and low Si(OH)(4):NO(3) ratios were due to high CaCO(3) production and low diatom production in surface waters. On the contrary, in the western subarctic Pacific and the Bering Sea, the low Redfieldian DIC:NO(3) ratios and the high Si(OH)(4):NO(3) ratios were due to low calcification and high diatom production. The annual new production was estimated from the seasonal drawdown of nitrate at the surface. It ranged from 10.1 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the subtropical gyre to 76-83 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in the western subarctic Pacific. Overall, horizontal advection was the major source of uncertainty in the estimation of new production. Finally, the net removal of carbon from the surface by the biological pump was then estimated to be 0.58 Gt C yr(-1) north of 35degreesN in the Pacific Ocean.

5298911,Proterozoic mountain building in Peninsular India: an analysis based primarily on alkaline rock distribution,"Peninsular India was assembled into a continental block c. 3 million km(2) in area as a result of collisions throughout the length of a 4000 kin long S-shaped mountain belt that was first recognized from the continuity of strike of highly deformed Proterozoic granulites and gneisses. More recently the recognition of a variety of tectonic indicators, including occurrences of ophiolitic slivers, Andean-margin type rocks, a collisional rift and a foreland basin, as well as many structural and isotopic age studies have helped to clarify the history of this Great Indian Proterozoic Fold Belt. We here complement those studies by considering the occurrence of deformed alkaline rocks and carbonatites (DARCs) in the Great Indian Proterozoic Fold Belt. One aim of this study is to test the recently published idea that DARCs result from the deformation of alkaline rocks and carbonatites (ARCs) originally intruded into intra-continental rifts and preserved on rifted continental margins. The suggestion is that ARCs from those margins are transformed into DARCs during continental, or arc-continental, collisions. If that idea is valid, DARCs lie on rifted continental margins and on coincident younger suture zones; they occur in places where ancient oceans have both opened and closed. Locating sutures within mountain belts has often proved difficult and has sometimes been controversial. If the new idea is valid, DARC distributions may help to reduce controversy. This paper concentrates on the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, where alkaline rock occurrences are best known. Less complete information from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, West Bengal, Bihar and Rajasthan has enabled us to define a line of 47 unevenly distributed DARCs with individual outcrop lengths of between 30 in and 30 km that extends along the full 4000 km length of the Great Indian Proterozoic Fold Belt.

Based on the geological conditions in this deposit of ore-forming fluids, H, O, C, S, Pb, Sr, and noble gas isotopic compositions were analyzed. Results show that O-18(SMOW) of quartz and calcite ranged from -9.85 to 4.17 parts per thousand, and D-SMOW ranged from -124.7 to -99.6 parts per thousand (where SMOW is the standard mean ocean water), indicating magma fluids mixed with meteoric water in ore-forming fluids. The C-13(PDB) and O-18(SMOW) values of calcite range from -1.4 to -1.1 parts per thousand and from 5.3 to 15.90 parts per thousand, respectively, show compositions consistent with the carbonate limestone in the surrounding rocks, implying that the carbon was primarily sourced from the dissolution of carbonate strata in the Luobadui Formation. The ore S-34 composition varied in a narrow range of 2.8 to 5.7 parts per thousand, mostly between 4 parts per thousand and 5 parts per thousand. The total sulfur isotopic value S-34 was 4.7 parts per thousand with characteristics of magmatic sulfur. The He-3/He-4 values of pyrite and galena ranged from 0.101 to 5.7Ra, lower than those of mantle-derived fluids (6 +/- 1 Ra), but higher than those of the crust (0.01-0.05 Ra), and therefore classified as a crust-mantle mixed source. The Pb isotopic composition for Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204, and Pb-208/Pb-204 values of the ores were in the ranges of 18.628-18.746, 15.698-15.802, and 39.077-39.430, respectively, consistent with the Pb isotopic composition of magmatic rocks in the deposit, classified as upper-crust lead.

5298904,Sulfur geochemistry of peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems: Comparing the Ligurian ophiolites with oceanic serpentinites,"Serpentinization processes at slow-and ultraslow-spreading ridges control the exchange of various elements between seawater and the oceanic lithosphere and play a major role in marine geochemical cycles. We use opaque mineral assemblages and sulfur isotope geochemistry to reconstruct variations in fluid fluxes, redox conditions and microbial activity prevailing during serpentinization and carbonate precipitation of serpentinites and ophicalcites from an ophiolite sequence in the Northern Apennines (Italy). We then compare our results with calcite-veined serpentinites from the Iberian Margin formed during the opening of the North Atlantic, and with serpentinites sampled at the active peridotite-hosted Lost City hydrothermal field on the Atlantis Massif near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The sulfide and oxide mineral assemblage of the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines is dominated by pyrite, pentlandite, millerite, siegenite, magnetite, and hematite, reflecting relatively oxidizing conditions, while the sulfur geochemistry reveals a dominance of sulfide sulfur over sulfate sulfur. delta S-34 values of sulfide and sulfate indicate that microbial sulfate reduction, leaching, and oxidation are the main processes that affected the sulfur isotope signature of these serpentinites. The opaque mineralogy in the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines is similar to that of the Iberian Margin and the southern wall of the Atlantis Massif, and generally represents the late stages of serpentinization, where intense fluid circulation leads to fairly oxidizing conditions and alkaline fluids lead to carbonate precipitation. However, the mineral assemblages also indicate strong fluctuations in oxygen fugacity, likely caused by volume expansion during serpentinization and tectonic activity along a mid-ocean ridge. Additionally, local enrichment in S-34 in sulfides suggests that fluids interacted at depth with gabbros and subsequently circulated along shear zones, similar to observations along detachment fault surfaces at the Atlantis Massif. Our results, therefore, give further evidence that the ophicalcites and serpentinites from the Northern Apennines formed in a tectonic setting similar to the Atlantis Massif. We estimate a global annual uptake of seawater sulfate of 5.6 to 12 x 10(11) g S by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks exposed to seawater on the ocean floor. We suggest that the thermal structure of the exposed mantle rocks and, in turn, the efficiency of microbes to reduce seawater sulfate to sulfide is a major factor controlling the storage of sulfur in serpentinites. Thus, cycling of sulfur in peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems during the Jurassic was probably very similar to the processes observed today in systems along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

We then compare our results with calcite-veined serpentinites from the Iberian Margin formed during the opening of the North Atlantic, and with serpentinites sampled at the active peridotite-hosted Lost City hydrothermal field on the Atlantis Massif near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The sulfide and oxide mineral assemblage of the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines is dominated by pyrite, pentlandite, millerite, siegenite, magnetite, and hematite, reflecting relatively oxidizing conditions, while the sulfur geochemistry reveals a dominance of sulfide sulfur over sulfate sulfur. delta S-34 values of sulfide and sulfate indicate that microbial sulfate reduction, leaching, and oxidation are the main processes that affected the sulfur isotope signature of these serpentinites. The opaque mineralogy in the serpentinites from the Northern Apennines is similar to that of the Iberian Margin and the southern wall of the Atlantis Massif, and generally represents the late stages of serpentinization, where intense fluid circulation leads to fairly oxidizing conditions and alkaline fluids lead to carbonate precipitation. However, the mineral assemblages also indicate strong fluctuations in oxygen fugacity, likely caused by volume expansion during serpentinization and tectonic activity along a mid-ocean ridge. Additionally, local enrichment in S-34 in sulfides suggests that fluids interacted at depth with gabbros and subsequently circulated along shear zones, similar to observations along detachment fault surfaces at the Atlantis Massif. Our results, therefore, give further evidence that the ophicalcites and serpentinites from the Northern Apennines formed in a tectonic setting similar to the Atlantis Massif. We estimate a global annual uptake of seawater sulfate of 5.6 to 12 x 10(11) g S by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks exposed to seawater on the ocean floor. We suggest that the thermal structure of the exposed mantle rocks and, in turn, the efficiency of microbes to reduce seawater sulfate to sulfide is a major factor controlling the storage of sulfur in serpentinites. Thus, cycling of sulfur in peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems during the Jurassic was probably very similar to the processes observed today in systems along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

The mixed reagent is optimized for pH and concentration of luminol and Co2+. Apart from Fe2+, none of the 14 species tested showed interference at their seawater levels.

5298894,Dynamics of the Carbonate System in the Western Indonesian Seas During the Southeast Monsoon,"We present a unique water column data set of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TAlk) from a cruise to the western Indonesian Seas during the southeast monsoon, covering the Karimata Strait, western Java Sea, and Sunda Strait. Salinity-normalized TAlk (NTAlk) in the surface water ranged 2,297-2,348 mu mol kg(-1), very close to typical values observed in the tropical ocean. In the Karimata Strait, the Kapuas River plume was observed, featuring low salinity, DIC, and TAlk. In the western Java Sea, where waters were well mixed, we observed relatively homogeneous distributions of salinity, DIC, and TAlk. In the Sunda Strait, waters intruding from the Java Sea occupied the upper layer, and below was the Indian Ocean water with lower values of salinity, DIC, and TAlk. In its deep portion, depth profiles of normalized DIC and NTAlk were very similar to those observed in the Indian Ocean. Physical processes and air-sea gas exchange exerted predominant controls on the carbonate system in the Karimata Strait and western Java Sea. While both processes play large roles in the Sunda Strait, a net DIC removal of 31 +/- 23 mu mol kg(-1) in the surface mixed layer were revealed.

5298893,Synoptic assessment of coastal total alkalinity through community science,"Comprehensive sampling of the carbonate system in estuaries and coastal waters can be difficult and expensive because of the complex and heterogeneous nature of near-shore environments. We show that sample collection by community science programs is a viable strategy for expanding estuarine carbonate system monitoring and prioritizing regions for more targeted assessment. 'Shell Day' was a single-day regional water monitoring event coordinating coastal carbonate chemistry observations by 59 community science programs and seven research institutions in the northeastern United States, in which 410 total alkalinity (TA) samples from 86 stations were collected. Field replicates collected at both low and high tides had a mean standard deviation between replicates of 3.6 +/- 0.3 mu mol kg(-1) (sigma(mean) +/- SE, n = 145) or 0.20 +/- 0.02%. This level of precision demonstrates that with adequate protocols for sample collection, handling, storage, and analysis, community science programs are able to collect TA samples leading to high-quality analyses and data. Despite correlations between salinity, temperature, and TA observed at multiple spatial scales, empirical predictions of TA had relatively high root mean square error >48 mu mol kg(-1). Additionally, ten stations displayed tidal variability in TA that was not likely driven by low TA freshwater inputs. As such, TA cannot be predicted accurately from salinity using a single relationship across the northeastern US region, though predictions may be viable at more localized scales where consistent freshwater and seawater endmembers can be defined. There was a high degree of geographic heterogeneity in both mean and tidal variability in TA, and this single-day snapshot sampling identified three patterns driving variation in TA, with certain locations exhibiting increased risk of acidification.

3868364,Immunological characterization of two types of ionocytes in the inner ear epithelium of Pacific Chub Mackerel (Scomber japonicus),"The inner ear is essential for maintaining balance and hearing predator and prey in the environment. Each inner ear contains three CaCO3 otolith polycrystals, which are calcified within an alkaline, K+-rich endolymph secreted by the surrounding epithelium. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood, especially in marine fish. Here, we investigated the presence and cellular localization of several ion-transporting proteins within the saccular epithelium of the Pacific Chub Mackerel (Scomber japonicus). Western blotting revealed the presence of Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), carbonic anhydrase (CA), Na+-K+-2Cl(-)-co-transporter (NKCC), vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (VHA), plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA), and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Immunohistochemistry analysis identified two distinct ionocytes types in the saccular epithelium: Type-I ionocytes were mitochondrion-rich and abundantly expressed NKA and NKCC in their basolateral membrane, indicating a role in secreting K+ into the endolymph. On the other hand, Type-II ionocytes were enriched in cytoplasmic CA and VHA, suggesting they help transport HCO3- into the endolymph and remove H+. In addition, both types of ionocytes expressed cytoplasmic PMCA, which is likely involved in Ca2+ transport and homeostasis, as well as sAC, an evolutionary conserved acid-base sensing enzyme that regulates epithelial ion transport.

5044938,Enhance Ocean Carbon Observations: Successful Implementation of a Novel Autonomous Total Alkalinity Analyzer on a Ship of Opportunity,"Over recent decades, observations based on merchant vessels (Ships of Opportunity-SOOP) equipped with sensors measuring the CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) in the surface seawater formed the backbone of the global ocean carbon observation system. However, the restriction to pCO(2) measurements alone is one severe shortcoming of the current SOOP observatory. Full insight into the marine inorganic carbon system requires the measurement of at least two of the four measurable variables which are pCO(2), total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and pH. One workaround is to estimate TA values based on established temperature-salinity parameterizations, but this leads to higher uncertainties and the possibility of regional and/or seasonal biases. Therefore, autonomous SOOP-based TA measurements are of great interest. Our study describes the implementation of a novel autonomous analyzer for seawater TA, the CONTROS HydroFIA (R) TA system (-4H-JENA engineering GmbH, Germany) for unattended routine TA measurements on a SOOP line operating in the North Atlantic. We present the installation in detail and address major issues encountered with autonomous measurements using this analyzer, e.g., automated cleaning and stabilization routines, and waste handling. Another issue during long-term deployments is the provision of reference seawater in large-volume containers for quality assurance measurements and drift correction. Hence, a stable large-volume seawater storage had to be found. We tested several container types with respect to their suitability to store seawater over a time period of 30 days without significant changes in TA. Only one gas sampling bag made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) satisfied the high stability requirement. In order to prove the performance of the entire setup, we compared the autonomous TA measurements with TA from discrete samples taken during the first two trans-Atlantic crossings. Although the measurement accuracy in unattended mode (about +/- 5 mu mol kg(-1)) slightly deteriorated compared to our previous system characterization, its overall uncertainty fulfilled requirements for autonomous TA measurements on SOOP lines.

5298888,Recovery of Alkaline Earth Metals from Desalination Brine for Carbon Capture and Sodium Removal,"Because carbon dioxide adsorbs the radiation from the Sun and the Earth's surface, global warming has become a severe problem in this century. Global warming causes many environmental problems such as heatwave, desertification, and erratic rainfall. Above all, erratic rainfall makes people have insufficient freshwater. To solve this problem, desalination technology has been developed in many countries. Although desalination technology can provide freshwater, it produces brine as well (producing 1 L of freshwater would result in 1 L of brine). The brine will decrease the dissolved oxygen in the sea and affect the organism's habitat. In this study, magnesium and calcium from desalination brine were recovered in the form of magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide by adjusting the pH value for carbon capture and sodium removal. Magnesium hydroxide would turn into magnesium carbonate through contacting CO2 in saturated amine carriers. Calcium hydroxide was added to the brine and reacted with CO2 (modified Solvay process). Sodium in brine would then be precipitated in the form of sodium bicarbonate. After removing sodium, brine can be released back into the ocean, or other valuable metals can be extracted from brine without the side effect of sodium. The results revealed that 288 K of 3-Amino-1-propanol could capture 15 L (26.9 g) of CO2 and that 25 g/L of Ca(OH)(2) at 288 K was the optimal parameter to remove 7000 ppm sodium and adsorb 16 L (28.7 g) of CO2 in the modified Solvay process.

North Yellow Sea, from March to November 2017 to study the dynamics of the carbonate system and its controlling factors. Results indicated that the studied parameters were highly variability over a range of spatiotemporal scales, comprehensively forced by various physical and biological processes. Mixing effect and scallop calcification played the most important role in the seasonal variation of total alkalinity (TAlk). For dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), in addition to mixing, air-sea exchange and microbial activity, e.g. photosynthesis and microbial respiration processes, had more important effects on its dynamics. Different from the former, the changes of water pH(T), partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and aragonite saturation state (Omega(A)) were mainly controlled by the combining of the temperature, air-sea exchange, microbial activity and scallop metabolic activities. In addition, the results indicated that massive scallop farming can significantly increase the DIC/TAlk ratio by reducing the TAlk concentration in seawater, thereby reducing the buffering capacity of the carbonate system in seawater especially for Omega(A). Preliminary calculated, similar to 75.7 and similar to 45.5 mu mol kg(-1) of TAlk were removed from the surface and bottom waters respectively in one scallop cultivating cycle.

GLODAPv2.2020 is an update of the previous version, GLODAPv2.2019. The major changes are data from 106 new cruises added, extension of time coverage to 2019, and the inclusion of available (also for historical cruises) discrete fugacity of CO2 (fCO(2)) values in the merged product files. GLODAPv2.2020 now includes measurements from more than 1.2 million water samples from the global oceans collected on 946 cruises. The data for the 12 GLODAP core variables (salinity, oxygen, nitrate, silicate, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, pH, CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and CCl4) have undergone extensive quality control with a focus on systematic evaluation of bias. The data are available in two formats: (i) as submitted by the data originator but updated to WOCE exchange format and (ii) as a merged data product with adjustments applied to minimize bias. These adjustments were derived by comparing the data from the 106 new cruises with the data from the 840 quality-controlled cruises of the GLODAPv2.2019 data product using crossover analysis. Comparisons to empirical algorithm estimates provided additional context for adjustment decisions; this is new to this version. The adjustments are intended to remove potential biases from errors related to measurement, calibration, and data-handling practices without removing known or likely time trends or variations in the variables evaluated.

1292995,Inorganic carbon fluxes on the Mackenzie Shelf of the Beaufort Sea,"The Mackenzie Shelf in the southeastern Beaufort Sea is a region that has experienced large changes in the past several decades as warming, sea-ice loss, and increased river discharge have altered carbon cycling. Upwelling and downwelling events are common on the shelf, caused by strong, fluctuating along-shore winds, resulting in cross-shelf Ek-man transport, and an alternating estuarine and anti-estuarine circulation. Downwelling carries dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and other remineralization products off the shelf and into the deep basin for possible long-term storage in the world's oceans. Upwelling carries DIC and nutrient-rich waters from the Pacific-origin upper halocline layer (UHL) onto the shelf. Profiles of DIC and total alkalinity (TA) taken in August and September of 2014 are used to investigate the cycling of carbon on the Mackenzie Shelf. The along-shore transport of water and the cross-shelf transport of DIC are quantified using velocity field output from a simulation of the Arctic and Northern Hemisphere Atlantic (ANHA4) configuration of the Nucleus of European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) framework. A strong upwelling event prior to sampling on the Mackenzie Shelf took place, bringing CO2-rich (elevated pCO(2)) water from the UHL onto the shelf bottom. The maximum on-shelf DIC flux was estimated at 16.9 x 10(3) mol Cd-1 m(-2) during the event. The maximum on-shelf transport of DIC through the upwelling event was found to be 65 +/- 15 x 10(3) Tg Cd-1. TA and the oxygen isotope ratio of water (delta O-18-H2O) are used to examine water-mass distributions in the study area and to investigate the influence of Pacific Water, Mackenzie River freshwater, and sea-ice melt on carbon dynamics and air-sea fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the surface mixed layer. Understanding carbon transfer in this seasonally dynamic environment is key to quantify the importance of Arctic shelf regions to the global carbon cycle and provide a basis for understanding how it will respond to the aforementioned climate-induced changes.",,Article,2018.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,1292995.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Inorganic carbon fluxes on the Mackenzie Shelf of the Beaufort Sea The Mackenzie Shelf in the southeastern Beaufort Sea is a region that has experienced large changes in the past several decades as warming, sea-ice loss, and increased river discharge have altered carbon cycling.

5298884,Magnesium isotope fractionation during alkaline brine evaporation and implications for Precambrian seawater chemistry,"The chemical evolution of the ocean is one major component of the puzzle of how climate and life have co-evolved over the Earth's history. A ""soda ocean"" with high alkalinity, high pH, and low calcium concentration in Precambrian has been proposed to explain the emergence and evolution of early life. However, this hypothesis has not been widely accepted due to the lack of reliable tracers for the chemical composition of Precambrian seawater. Evaporite is formed during seawater/brine evaporation and thus has been widely used to reconstruct the ancient seawater/brine chemical composition. Here, evaporation experiments were conducted using Qinghai Lake (QHL) water, a modern soda lake, to provide an analogy of the Precambrian ""soda ocean"" evaporation and investigate the mineralogical and Mg isotopic signatures of alkaline brine-derived evaporites. Our results show that the evaporation path of QHL water overall covers the stages of hydrous Mg carbonates (hydromagnesite), halite, and bloedite [Na2Mg(SO4)(2).4H(2)O] precipitation. The precipitation of hydrous Mg carbonates and bloedite is distinct from the modern seawater evaporation and is accompanied by the removal of up to 85% Mg from brine. The brine gradually becomes enriched in heavy Mg isotopes during evaporation due to the preferential incorporation of light Mg isotopes into precipitates. The fractionation of Mg isotopes is dominantly controlled by the bond structure during hydrous Mg carbonates and bloedite precipitation, and the latter is also slightly influenced by the kinetics in the highly concentrated brine. The Mg isotope fractionation during bloedite dissolution is limited due to the rapid congruent dissolution. The significant Mg isotopic fractionation observed within the hydrous Mg carbonates precipitation during the earliest QHL water evaporation indicates the potential Rayleigh distillation of Mg by alkalinity in the ""soda ocean"", which is absent in the Phanerozoic oceans. Therefore, the large Mg isotope fractionation during alkaline brine evaporation can be applied to test the existence of Precambrian ""soda oceans"".",Magnesium isotopes; Soda ocean hypothesis; Evaporites; Bloedite; Qinghai Lake,Article,2021.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,2.0,0.0,5298884.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Magnesium isotope fractionation during alkaline brine evaporation and implications for Precambrian seawater chemistry Magnesium isotopes; Soda ocean hypothesis; Evaporites; Bloedite; Qinghai Lake The chemical evolution of the ocean is one major component of the puzzle of how climate and life have co-evolved over the Earth's history.

5298882,Estimates of Water-Column Nutrient Concentrations and Carbonate System Parameters in the Global Ocean: A Novel Approach Based on Neural Networks,"A neural network-based method (CANYON: CArbonate system and Nutrients concentration from hYdrological properties and Oxygen using a Neural-network) was developed to estimate water-column (i.e., from surface to 8,000m depth) biogeochemically relevant variables in the Global Ocean. These are the concentrations of three nutrients [nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO43-), and silicate (Si(OH)(4))] and four carbonate system parameters [total alkalinity (AT), dissolved inorganic carbon (CT), pH (pHT), and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2))], which are estimated from concurrent in situ measurements of temperature, salinity, hydrostatic pressure, and oxygen (O-2) together with sampling latitude, longitude, and date. Seven neural-networks were developed using the GLODAPv2 database, which is largely representative of the diversity of open-ocean conditions, hence making CANYON potentially applicable to most oceanic environments. For each variable, CANYON was trained using 80 % randomly chosen data from the whole database (after eight 10 degrees x 10 degrees zones removed providing an ""independent data set"" for additional validation), the remaining 20 % data were used for the neural network test of validation. Overall, CANYON retrieved the variables with high accuracies (RMSE): 1.04 mu mol kg(-1) (NO3-), 0.074 it mol kg(-1) (PO43-, 3.2 mu mol kg(-1) (Si(OH)(4)), 0.020 (pH(T)), 9 mu mol kg(-1) (AT), 11 mu mol kg(-1) (CT) and 7.6 % (CO2) (30 IA atm at 400 it,atm). This was confirmed for the eight independent zones not included in the training process. CANYON was also applied to the Hawaiian Time Series site to produce a 22 years long simulated time series for the above seven variables. Comparison of modeled and measured data was also very satisfactory (RMSE in the order of magnitude of RMSE from validation test). CANYON is thus a promising method to derive distributions of key biogeochemical variables. It could be used for a variety of global and regional applications ranging from data quality control to the production of datasets of variables required for initialization and validation of biogeochemical models that are difficult to obtain. In particular, combining the increased coverage of the global Biogeochemical-Argo program, where O-2 is one of the core variables now very accurately measured, with the CANYON approach offers the fascinating perspective of obtaining large-scale estimates of key biogeochemical variables with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.

5298881,Carbonate chemistry of the Dongsha Atoll Lagoon in the northern South,"In this study, we investigated the seawater carbonate chemistry in the Dongsha Atoll Lagoon (DAL) in summer 2015, summer 2016, and autumn 2016. According to the calculation of the total alkalinity anomaly (Delta TA), the DAL is currently maintaining a net calcification status, with higher calcification potential in summer and lower calcification potential in autumn. The calculation of the partial pressure of CO2 anomaly (Delta pCO2) shows that the DAL acts as a CO2 source for the atmosphere, with higher Delta pCO2 values in summer and lower values in autumn. In addition to seasonal variation, Delta pCO2 also exhibits a clear variation between two summer investigations, with higher values in summer 2016 than in summer 2015, which could be associated with the different weather conditions during the sampling periods (2015 vs. 2016: sunny vs. stormy). Moreover, analyzing the salinity-normalized total alkalinity vs. dissolved inorganic carbon relationship reveals that calcification was the dominant process controlling the CO2 dynamics in summer 2015, while those in summer 2016 were regulated mainly by the combination of calcification and organic respiration. This result further suggests that the change in the organic carbon metabolism induced by the different weather conditions could be the driving force behind the observed variation in pCO2 between summer 2015 and 2016.",Carbonate chemistry; Dongsha Atoll; Coral reef; CO2; Ocean acidification; South China Sea,Article,2021.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,2.0,0.0,5298881.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Carbonate chemistry of the Dongsha Atoll Lagoon in the northern South Carbonate chemistry; Dongsha Atoll; Coral reef; CO2; Ocean acidification; South China Sea In this study, we investigated the seawater carbonate chemistry in the Dongsha Atoll Lagoon (DAL) in summer 2015, summer 2016, and autumn 2016.

5298873,Buffered accelerated weathering of limestone for storing CO2: Chemical background,"We present an evolution of the Accelerated Weathering of Limestone (AWL) method to store CO2 in seawater in the form of bicarbonates. Buffered Accelerated Weathering of Limestone (BAWL) is designed to produce a buffered ionic solution, at seawater pH, which derives from the reaction between a CO2 stream and a powder of micron-sized calcium carbonate particles in a long tubular reactor. Addition of calcium hydroxide to buffer the unreacted CO2 before the discharge in seawater is also provided. BAWL aims to overcome the main limitations of AWL, such as the high amount of water needed, the large size of the reactor, the risk of CO2 degassing back into the atmosphere, if the ionic solution is released into shallow waters, as well as the induced seawater acidification. This paper presents the chemical background of the technology and evaluates its feasibility by considering the chemical equilibria in the different phases of the process. The CO2 emitted for limestone calcination leads to a 24% CO2 penalty; a preliminary cost analysis assesses a storage cost of 100 (sic) per tonne of CO2 from an external source.

5298869,Applying the new TrOCA approach to assess the distribution of anthropogenic CO2 in the Atlantic Ocean,"Based on the recently proposed composite tracer 'TrOCA', a novel and independent approach is developed to estimate the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 in marine systems. It is shown that the precision of this simple model can be as high as 3 to 5.9 mumol kg(-1). Several assumptions currently used in some previous back-calculation methods become irrelevant by using the new tracer TrOCA (e.g. constant air-sea disequilibrium, negligible diapyenal mixing, and/or ventilation age of water masses deduced from anthropogenic tracers). The model is then applied throughout the Atlantic Ocean to estimate the concentrations of anthropogenic CO2, using only the four properties TCO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon), TA (total alkalinity), O-2 (mygen), and theta (potential temperature), all available from the CARINA database. The results, which are computed for the 1980s and the 1990s, are in good agreement with the distribution of three independent anthropogenic tracers (Delta(14)C, H-3, and CFC-11). The anthropogenic CO2 inventory within the Atlantic Ocean (80degreesN-50degreesS) reaches similar to40 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) in the 1980s, and it increases LIP to similar to45 Gt C during the 1990s. From one decade to another, the largest increase of inventory occurs in the southern Atlantic Ocean (33.6%), whereas in the northern basin it reaches only 4.3%. The southern Atlantic Ocean is currently playing an important role in sequestrating a large fraction of the excess CO2. The Atlantic Ocean is storing anthropogenic CO2 at a net rate of 0.66 Gt C year(-1). Extrapolating this estimate to the world ocean, a total of 1.97 Gt C year(-1) could have been effectively stored in the ocean interior over the period 1984-1995. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

5298867,Riverine evidence for a fractionated reservoir of Ca and Mg on the continents: Implications for the oceanic Ca cycle,"Analysis of river water, rock, travertine and soil from the high altitude, negligible vegetation setting of the Southern Tibetan Plateau demonstrates that Ca and Mg isotope ratios are fractionated during weathering. Dissolved Ca in the two rivers studied is derived primarily by limestone dissolution. delta Ca-44/42 in the rivers averages 0.43 parts per thousand and is statistically distinct from limestone at 0.31 parts per thousand. The range in delta Ca-44/42 in these small rivers is 0.43 parts per thousand, equivalent to the entire range in delta Ca-44/42 recorded in marine carbonate over the last 80Ma. Precipitation of isotopically light travertine with a delta Ca-44/42 of 0.21 parts per thousand enriches solute Ca in heavy isotopes. The Mg isotope composition of the rivers is intermediate between limestone and silicate rock averaging -1.5%.. Silicate soil has a delta Mg-26 of -0.03 parts per thousand, heavier than silicate rock by 0.5 parts per thousand. These fractionations in the soil create a companion groundwater reservoir of heavy Ca and light Mg. Seasonal variations in Ca and Mg isotope ratios in the dissolved load are small, but define an array which can be modelled as a mixture between a fractionated groundwater reservoir and surface runoff (reflecting the isotopic composition of the lithology). Fractionation of Ca during the weathering of the continents is of importance to the global cycle of Ca. The riverine input of Ca to the oceans (dominated by carbonate weathering) is controlled not only by the composition of the primary continental crust but also by the size and composition of a fractionated reservoir on the continents.

387762,The continental shelf carbon pump in the northern Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea): Influence of wintertime variability,"The northern Adriatic Sea, a marginal sea of the Mediterranean, is both a highly productive shelf area and a dense water formation site. The combination of productivity and dense water formation on the shelf (i.e., the continental shelf carbon pump process) enhances the vertical transport of carbon into the interior of the Mediterranean Sea contributing to the atmospheric CO2 sequestration. In this study, the carbon air sea exchange and the continental shelf pump process are investigated by coupling the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) with a biogeochemical model (AdriBio) that includes a carbonate dynamics module. The results of the numerical simulations show that the northern Adriatic Sea is currently a CO2 sink, with an annual flux of approximately 2.9 mmol/m(2)/d. The carbon cycle on the continental shelf is the result of a complex interaction of several processes that induce significant temporal and spatial variability in CO2 fluxes and transport. Simulation results show that winter cooling affects the solubility of CO2 on a basin-wide scale and governs the intensity of the vertical transport of carbon out of the shelf by modulating both the properties and the volume of the newly formed dense water masses. In warm winter conditions, the mitigation of the solubility pump process and the reduced dense water formation result in a significant decrease in atmospheric CO2 sequestration and deep-carbon transport with respect to the reference condition. Biological processes (i.e., net primary production and sink of particulate matter) contribute up to more than half of the CO2 air sea flux, but they must be spatially synchronized with the dense water formation to maximize the efficiency of the carbon transport into the deepest layers of the Adriatic Sea. Finally, the terrestrial input of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity and the exchanges across the Otranto Strait can affect the carbonate system equilibrium in the area hence the magnitude of the air sea CO2 exchange but have little impact on the deep-carbon transport.

Using a global model, we show that such alkalinization has the potential to preserve pH and the saturation state of carbonate minerals at close to today's values. Effects of alkalinization persist after termination: Atmospheric CO2 and pH do not return to unmitigated levels. Only scenarios in which large amounts of alkalinity (i.e., in a ratio of 2:1 with respect to emitted CO2) are added over large ocean areas can boost oceanic CO2 uptake sufficiently to avoid further ocean acidification on the global scale, thereby elevating some key biogeochemical parameters, e.g., pH significantly above preindustrial levels.

830112,Carbon and nitrogen fluxes in a closed seawater facility,"A variety of empirical and calculated data from the largest tank at the New Jersey State Aquarium were used to quantify the fluxes of carbon and nitrogen before and after the installation of denitrification in this facility. Before denitrification, the stock of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in Ocean Tank exhibited a decrease of 6.9 kg C/month and sodium bicarbonate had to be added to maintain DIC in steady state. We were able to explain the DIC decrease by two non-conservative processes: the formation of carbonaceous precipitates (removes 4.2 kg C/month) and outgassing of carbon dioxide due to acidity from nitrification (independently determined to remove 3.2 kg C/month). Nitrogen budget in Ocean Tank before denitrification is in contrast to that of carbon, and it shows an increase of 4.8 kg N/month in the form of nitrate. Denitrification is currently removing 53.3 kg N/month (in the form of nitrogen gas), so this element should eventually reach steady state. The use of methanol for denitrification has resulted in a flux of 26.3 kg C/month into the aquarium and, as predicted, an increase in Ocean Tank DIC stock has been observed without any additions of sodium bicarbonate.

662160,Transient tracer distributions in the Fram Strait in 2012 and inferred anthropogenic carbon content and transport,"The storage of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean's interior is an important process which modulates the increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. The polar regions are expected to be net sinks for anthropogenic carbon. Transport estimates of dissolved inorganic carbon and the anthropogenic offset can thus provide information about the magnitude of the corresponding storage processes. Here we present a transient tracer, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) data set along 78 degrees 50' N sampled in the Fram Strait in 2012. A theory on tracer relationships is introduced, which allows for an application of the inverse-Gaussian-transit-time distribution (IG-TTD) at high latitudes and the estimation of anthropogenic carbon concentrations. Mean current velocity measurements along the same section from 2002-2010 were used to estimate the net flux of DIC and anthropogenic carbon by the boundary currents above 840 m through the Fram Strait. The new theory explains the differences between the theoretical (IG-TTD-based) tracer age relationship and the specific tracer age relationship of the field data, by saturation effects during water mass formation and/or the deliberate release experiment of SF6 in the Greenland Sea in 1996, rather than by different mixing or ventilation processes. Based on this assumption, a maximum SF6 excess of 0.5-0.8 fmol kg(-1) was determined in the Fram Strait at intermediate depths (500-1600 m). The anthropogenic carbon concentrations are 50-55 mu mol kg(-1) in the Atlantic Water/Recirculating Atlantic Water, 40-45 mu mol kg(-1) in the Polar Surface Water/warm Polar Surface Water and between 10 and 35 mu mol kg(-1) in the deeper water layers, with lowest concentrations in the bottom layer.

1301114,Temporal Changes in Seawater Carbonate Chemistry and Carbon Export from a Southern California Estuary,"Estuaries are important subcomponents of the coastal ocean, but knowledge about the temporal and spatial variability of their carbonate chemistry, as well as their contribution to coastal and global carbon fluxes, are limited. In the present study, we measured the temporal and spatial variability of biogeochemical parameters in a saltmarsh estuary in Southern California, the San Dieguito Lagoon (SDL). We also estimated the flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total organic carbon (TOC) to the adjacent coastal ocean over diel and seasonal timescales. The combined net flux of DIC and TOC (FDIC + TOC) to the ocean during outgoing tides ranged from - 1.8 +/- 0.5 x 10(3) to 9.5 +/- 0.7 x 10(3) mol C h(-1) during baseline conditions. Based on these fluxes, a rough estimate of the net annual export of DIC and TOC totaled 10 +/- 4 x 10(6) mol C year(-1). Following a major rain event (36 mm rain in 3 days), FDIC + TOC increased and reached values as high as 29.0 +/- 0.7 x 10(3) mol C h(-1).

3597935,Altered groundwater discharge and associated carbon fluxes in a wetland-drained coastal canal,"Residential canal systems are becoming increasingly popular with the rising demand for absolute coastal waterfront properties. We hypothesize that canals alter groundwater-surface water connectivity and related carbon fluxes into coastal surface waters. Here, we quantified submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in a residential canal system on Bribie Island (Australia) and associated carbon fluxes. SGD rates estimated from a radon (Rn-222) mass balance model were 3.1 +/- 1.5 cm d(-1). These fluxes delivered 68 +/- 44 and 70 +/- 48 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the canal, respectively. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere ranged from 15 to 28 mmol m(-2) d(-1). Multiple lines of evidence, including flux estimates and groundwater observations, converge to the conclusion that SGD was a major source of DOC and free CO2, but not carbonate alkalinity nor DIC to canal surface waters. In comparison to mangrove tidal creeks that often precede canals, the canal had (1) lower tidally-driven saline groundwater exchange rates but higher fresh groundwater discharge, (2) lower CO2 emissions to the atmosphere; and (3) acted as a driver rather than a buffer of local ocean acidification.

Most OTEC energy potential is far offshore, thus the conversion of the produced electricity to a chemical energy carrier such as H-2 or derivatives is required. This can be achieved by employing a method of electrochemically generating H-2 that also consumes CO2, converting the carbon to a common form of ocean alkalinity.

1288767,A Model-Based Evaluation of the Inverse Gaussian Transit-Time Distribution Method for Inferring Anthropogenic Carbon Storage in the Ocean,"The Inverse Gaussian approximation of transit time distribution method (IG-TTD) is widely used to infer the anthropogenic carbon (C-ant) concentration in the ocean from measurements of transient tracers such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Its accuracy relies on the validity of several assumptions, notably (i) a steady state ocean circulation, (ii) a prescribed age tracer saturation history, e.g., a constant 100% saturation, (iii) a prescribed constant degree of mixing in the ocean, (iv) a constant surface ocean air-sea CO2 disequilibrium with time, and (v) that preformed alkalinity can be sufficiently estimated by salinity or salinity and temperature. Here, these assumptions are evaluated using simulated ""modeltruth'' of Cant. The results give the IG-TTD method a range of uncertainty from 7.8% to 13.6% (11.4 Pg C to 19.8 Pg C) due to above assumptions, which is about half of the uncertainty derived in previous model studies. Assumptions (ii), (iv) and (iii) are the three largest sources of uncertainties, accounting for 5.5%, 3.8% and 3.0%, respectively, while assumptions (i) and (v) only contribute about 0.6% and 0.7%. Regionally, the Southern Ocean contributes the largest uncertainty, of 7.8%, while the North Atlantic contributes about 1.3%. Our findings demonstrate that spatial-dependency of Delta/Gamma, and temporal changes in tracer saturation and air-sea CO2 disequilibrium have strong compensating effect on the estimated C-ant.

1280565,Potential ecotoxicological effects of elevated bicarbonate ion concentrations on marine organisms,"Recently, a novel method for carbon capture and storage has been proposed, which converts gaseous CO2 into aqueous bicarbonate ions (HCO3-), allowing it to be deposited into the ocean. This alkalinization method could be used to dispose large amounts of CO2 without acidifying seawater pH, but there is no information on the potential adverse effects of consequently elevated HCO3- concentrations on marine organisms. In this study, we evaluated the ecotoxicological effects of elevated concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (max 193 mM) on 10 marine organisms. We found species-specific ecotoxicological effects of elevated DIC on marine organisms, with EC50-DIC (causing 50% inhibition) of 11-85 mM. The tentative criteria for protecting 80% of individuals of marine organisms are suggested to be pH 7.8 and 11 mM DIC, based on acidification data previously documented and alkalinization data newly obtained from this study.

4911665,Seeking natural analogs to fast-forward the assessment of marine CO2 removal,"Mitigating global climate change will require gigaton-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as a supplement to rapid emissions reduction. The oceans cover 71% of the Earth surface and have the potential to provide much of the required CDR. However, none of the proposed marine CDR (mCDR) methods is sufficiently well understood to determine their real-world efficiency and environmental side effects. Here, we argue that using natural mCDR analogs should become the third interconnecting pillar in the mCDR assessment as they bridge the gap between numerical simulations (i.e., large scale/reduced complexity) and experimental studies (i.e., small scale/high complexity). Natural mCDR analogs occur at no cost, can provide a wealth of data to inform mCDR, and do not require legal permission or social license for their study. We propose four simple criteria to identify particularly useful analogs: 1) large scale, 2) abruptness of perturbation, 3) availability of unperturbed control sites, and 4) reoccurrence. Based on these criteria, we highlight four examples: 1) equatorial upwelling as a natural analog for artificial upwelling, 2) downstream of Kerguelen Island for ocean iron fertilization, 3) the Black and Caspian Seas for ocean alkalinity enhancement, and 4) the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt for ocean afforestation. These natural analogs provide a reality check for experimental assessments and numerical modeling of mCDR.

793107,Anthropogenic CO2 in a dense water formation area of the Mediterranean Sea,"There is growing evidence that the on-going ocean acidification of the Mediterranean Sea could be favoured by its active overturning circulation. The areas of dense water formation are, indeed, preferential sites for atmospheric carbon dioxide absorption and through them the ocean acidification process can quickly propagate into the deep layers. In this study we estimated the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 (C-ant) in the dense water formation areas of the middle and southern Adriatic Sea. Using the composite tracer TrOCA (Tracer combining Oxygen, inorganic Carbon, and total Alkalinity) and carbonate chemistry data collected throughout March 2013, our results revealed that a massive amount of C-ant) has invaded all the identified water masses. High C-ant) concentration was detected at the bottom layer of the Pomo Pit (middle Adriatic, 96.8 +/- 9.7 pmol kg(-1)) and Southern Adriatic Pit (SAP, 85.2 +/- 9.4 pmol kg(-1)), associated respectively with the presence of North Adriatic Dense Water (NAdDW) and Adriatic Dense Water (AdDW). This anthropogenic contamination was clearly linked to the dense water formation events, which govern strong CO2 flux from the atmosphere to the sea and the sinking of dense, CO2-rich surface waters to the deep sea. However, a very high C-ant level (94.5 +/- 12.5 pmol kg(-1)) was also estimated at the intermediate layer, as a consequence of a recent vertical mixing that determined the physical and biogeochemical modification of the water of Levantine origin (i.e. Modified Levantine Intermediate Water, MLIW) and favoured the atmospheric CO2 intrusion.

The areas of dense water formation are, indeed, preferential sites for atmospheric carbon dioxide absorption and through them the ocean acidification process can quickly propagate into the deep layers. In this study we estimated the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 (C-ant) in the dense water formation areas of the middle and southern Adriatic Sea. Using the composite tracer TrOCA (Tracer combining Oxygen, inorganic Carbon, and total Alkalinity) and carbonate chemistry data collected throughout March 2013, our results revealed that a massive amount of C-ant) has invaded all the identified water masses. High C-ant) concentration was detected at the bottom layer of the Pomo Pit (middle Adriatic, 96.8 +/- 9.7 pmol kg(-1)) and Southern Adriatic Pit (SAP, 85.2 +/- 9.4 pmol kg(-1)), associated respectively with the presence of North Adriatic Dense Water (NAdDW) and Adriatic Dense Water (AdDW). This anthropogenic contamination was clearly linked to the dense water formation events, which govern strong CO2 flux from the atmosphere to the sea and the sinking of dense, CO2-rich surface waters to the deep sea. However, a very high C-ant level (94.5 +/- 12.5 pmol kg(-1)) was also estimated at the intermediate layer, as a consequence of a recent vertical mixing that determined the physical and biogeochemical modification of the water of Levantine origin (i.e. Modified Levantine Intermediate Water, MLIW) and favoured the atmospheric CO2 intrusion.

636420,Controls on carbonate skeletal mineralogy: Global CO2 evolution and mass extinctions,"A quantitative compilation of carbonate skeletal mineralogy through the Phanerozoic shows a progressive replacement of low-Mg calcite by aragonite. This general trend overrides the subsidiary trend of greenhouse intervals favoring biogenic low-Mg calcite mineralogies (calcite seas), and icehouse intervals facilitating aragonite + high-Mg calcite mineralogies (aragonite seas). The replacement of low-Mg calcite by aragonite was, however, achieved episodically at mass extinction intervals. In particular, the end-Permian extinction both preferentially removed species bearing ""unfavorable"" low-Mg calcite, and allowed the selective radiation of biota with ""favorable"" aragonite. This demonstrates the importance of incumbency in the evolution of skeletal mineralogy. We suggest that the broad increase of aragonitic biota has been controlled by changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO(2)) via carbonate mineral kinetics. Through the Phanerozoic, broadly decreasing pCO(2) levels led to decreasing total alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon, and increasing oceanic pH. Superimposed upon this general trend, there are cyclic episodes of relatively high pCO(2) and saturation state combined with a lower ratio of magnesium to calcium ions in seawater driven by the relatively slow changes in mid-ocean ridge expansion rates.

5213677,Reversing ocean acidification along the Great Barrier Reef using alkalinity injection,"The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a globally significant coral reef system supporting productive and diverse ecosystems. The GBR is under increasing threat from climate change and local anthropogenic stressors, with its general condition degrading over recent decades.

In this study, we use a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model of the GBR and surrounding ocean to simulate artificial ocean alkalinisation (AOA) as a means to reverse the impact of global ocean acidification on GBR reefs. Our results demonstrate that a continuous release of 90 000 t of alkalinity every 3 d over one year along the entire length of the GBR, following the Gladstone-Weipa bulk carrier route, increases the mean aragonite saturation state (Omega(ar)) across the GBR's 3860 reefs by 0.05.

4792805,Technical note: Excess alkalinity in carbonate system reference materials,"Certified reference materials (CRMs) for oceanic carbonate system measurements are critical for verifying the accuracy of laboratory protocols and the reliability of field sensors.

In experimentation initially designed to measure the total boron to salinity ratio of seawater, an interesting result has emerged regarding CRMs. A unique acidimetric titration method has indicated that three different batches of CRM contain excess alkalinity (i.e., alkalinity that is not attributable to inorganic bases included in the traditional definition of seawater total alkalinity) that is statistically greater than the excess alkalinity measured in open-ocean water from the Gulf of Mexico. Further, the amount of excess alkalinity appears to differ in certain CRM batches. Excess alkalinity in CRMs is likely caused by organic proton acceptors that are not completely oxidized by the ultraviolet sterilization procedure that CRMs undergo. The primary use of CRMs - to maintain the accuracy and consistency of carbonate system measurements - may be inhibited by excess alkalinity, which can cause differences in total alkalinity values determined by different titration methods.

Both configurations use the acid and base produced by the membrane electrodialysis of ocean water. The first configuration, termed the 'acid process', cidifies ocean water or brine to shift the carbonate buffer system towards dissolved CO2 gas, which is vacuum stripped from the acidified brine. The second configuration, termed the 'base process', adds base to the brine to shift the carbonate buffer system towards carbonate ions, which precipitates as CaCO3. A closed loop cycle is achieved by returning this decarbonized and alkalinized brine to the ocean for additional CO2 absorption from the air. Our evaluation of this prototype scale system focused on the parameters that have the most influence on the ultimate cost of the extracted CO2.

However, sensory compensation may allow fish to use alternative settlement cues such as sound.

5241304,Use of aircraft in ocean alkalinity enhancement,"Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is a proposed Negative Emissions Technology (NET) to remove atmospheric CO2 through the dispersion of alkaline materials (e.g.: calcium hydroxide, slaked lime, SL) into seawater, simultaneously counteracting ocean acidification. This study considers aircraft discharge of SL and its consequent dry deposition, extending to the marine environment a technique used in freshwater. A feasibility analysis assesses potential, costs, benefits, and disadvantages, considering scenarios with different assumptions on aircraft size, discharge height and duration, and wind conditions. Due to the small size of SL particles (median diameter 9 mu m), the dispersion from aircraft is highly enhanced by wind drift; the smallest SL particles may drift thousands of kilometres, especially if discharged from elevated altitudes. This could pose problems related to powders particles settling on remote lands. Although calcium hydroxide maximum concentration into water (from 0.01 to 82 mg L-1) is for almost all the scenarios lower than the most stringent threshold for the ecosystem impacts on a 96-h exposure, the ecologically sensitive sea surface microlayer (SAIL) should be considered in detail. The high CO2 emissions of the Landing to Take-Off Cycle (LTO) of the aircraft and their limited payload lead to a significant CO2 penalty, ranging in analysed scenarios between 28% and 77% of the CO2 removal potential; very fast discharge could reduce the penalty to 11% -32%.

5241301,CO2 capture by pumping surface acidity to the deep ocean,"To remain below 2 degrees C of warming, most IPCC pathways call for active CO2 removal (CDR). On geological timescales, ocean uptake regulates atmospheric CO2 concentration, with two homeostats driving CO2 uptake: dissolution of deep ocean carbonate deposits (1 ka timescales) and terrestrial weathering of silicate rocks (100 ka timescales). Many current ocean-based CDR proposals effectively act to accelerate the latter. Here we present a method which relies purely on the redistribution and dilution of acidity from a thin layer of the surface ocean to a thicker layer of deep ocean, in order to reduce surface acidification and accelerate carbonate homeostasis. This downward transport could be seen analogous to the action of the natural biological carbon pump. The method offers advantages over other ocean alkalinity and CO2-stripping methods: the conveyance of mass is minimized (acidity is pumped in situ to depth), and expensive mining, grinding and distribution of alkaline material is eliminated. No dilute substance needs to be concentrated, reducing the quantity of seawater to be processed. Finally, no terrestrial material is added to the ocean, avoiding significant alteration of seawater ion concentrations or issues with heavy metal toxicity (encountered in mineral-based alkalinity schemes). The artificial transport of acidity accelerates the natural deep ocean compensation by calcium carbonate. It has been estimated that the total compensation capacity of the ocean is on the order of 1500 GtC. We show through simulation that pumping of ocean acidity could remove up to 150 GtC from the atmosphere by 2100 without excessive increase of local pH. The permanence of the CO2 storage depends on the depth of acid pumping. At >3000 m, similar to 85% is retained for at least 300 years, and >50% for at least 2000 years. Shallow pumping (<2000 m) offers more of a stop-gap deferral of emissions for a few hundred years. Uptake efficiency and residence time also vary with the location of acidity pumping. Requiring only local resources (ocean water and energy), this method could be uniquely suited to utilize otherwise-unusable open ocean energy sources at scale.

On geological timescales, ocean uptake regulates atmospheric CO2 concentration, with two homeostats driving CO2 uptake: dissolution of deep ocean carbonate deposits (1 ka timescales) and terrestrial weathering of silicate rocks (100 ka timescales). Many current ocean-based CDR proposals effectively act to accelerate the latter. Here we present a method which relies purely on the redistribution and dilution of acidity from a thin layer of the surface ocean to a thicker layer of deep ocean, in order to reduce surface acidification and accelerate carbonate homeostasis.

2504123,"Dust storms come to Central and Southwestern China, too: implications from a major dust event in Chongqing","Dust storms from major Asian sources are usually carried by northwesterly or westerly winds over Northern and Southeastern China to the Pacific Ocean. These pathways leave Central and Southwestern China nearly free of incursions. But a strong dust event on 5-6 May 2005 was captured in a 15-month series of weekly filter samples of PM2.5 at three sites in Chongqing. It illustrated that desert dust can be transported to this region, and sometimes strongly. Annual PM2.5 and dust were similar at the three sites, but higher than in simultaneous samples in Beijing. High correlations of dust concentrations were found between the cities during spring, indicating that Asian dust affects a broader swath of China than is often realized. During the event, the concentrations of mineral dust were high at all sites (20-30 mu g m(-3); 15%-20% of PM2.5 in Chongqing, and 15 mu g m(-3); 20%-30% of PM2.5 in Beijing), and were part of a broader spring maximum. The proportions of crustal elements and pollution-derived components such as Pb, SO42-, and organic carbon indicated that the sources for this dust differed from Beijing. The dust was considerably enriched in Ca and Mg, characteristic of western deserts, whereas Beijing's dust had the lower Ca and Mg of eastern deserts.

845234,An Assessment of Direct Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Injection to the Coastal Region: A Model Result,"The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased in the past 60 years and the technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS) has recently been extensively studied.

However, the carbonate dynamics and air-sea gas exchange are usually neglected in a CCS strategy. This study assesses the effect of a DIC-solution injection by using a simple two end-member model to simulate the variation of pH, DIC, total alkalinity (TA) and pCO(2) between the river and sea mixing process for the Danshuei River estuary and Hoping River in Taiwan. We observed that the DIC-solution injection can contribute to ocean acidification and can also lead the pCO(2) value to change from being undersaturated to oversaturated (with respect to the atmospheric CO2 level). Our model result also showed that the maximum Revelle factors (Delta[CO2]/[CO2])/(Delta[DIC]/[DIC]) among varied pH values (6-9) and DIC concentrations (0.5-3.5 mmol kg(-1)) were between pH 8.3 and 8.5 in fresh water and were between 7.3 and 7.5 in waters with a salinity of 35, reflecting the changing efficiency of dissolving CO2 gas into the DIC solution and the varying stability of this desired DIC solution.

2128290,Carbon cycling in a zero-discharge mariculture system,"Interest in mariculture systems will rise in the near future due to the decreased ability of the ocean to supply the increasing demand for seafood. We present a trace study using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes and chemical profiles of a zero-discharge mariculture system stocked with the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). Water quality maintenance in the system is based on two biofiltration steps. Firstly, an aerobic treatment step comprising a trickling filter in which ammonia is oxidized to nitrate. Secondly, an anaerobic step comprised of a digestion basin and a fluidized bed reactor where excess organic matter and nitrate are removed. Dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity values were higher in the anaerobic loop than in the aerobic loop, in agreement with the main biological processes taking place in the two treatment steps. The delta C-13 of the dissolved inorganic carbon (delta C-13(DIG)) was depleted in C-13 in the anaerobic loop as compared to the aerobic loop by 2.5-3 parts per thousand. This is in agreement with the higher dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in the anaerobic loop and the low water retention time and the chemolithotrophic activity of the aerobic loop. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 of organic matter in the mariculture system indicated that fish fed solely on feed pellets. Compared to feed pellets and particulate organic matter, the sludge in the digestion basin was enriched in N-15 while delta C-13 was not significantly different.

3304831,Examining the Impact of Tropical Cyclones on Air-Sea CO2 Exchanges in the Bay of Bengal Based on Satellite Data and In Situ Observations,"The impact of tropical cyclones (TCs) on the CO2 partial pressure at the sea surface (pCO(2sea)) and air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) was quantified based on satellite data and in situ observations between November 2013 and January 2017. The in situ observations were made at the BoB Ocean Acidification mooring buoy. A weak time-mean net source of 55.78 +/- 11.16 mmol CO2 m(-2) year(-1) at the BoB Ocean Acidification site was estimated during this period. A wide range in increases of pCO(2sea) (1.0-14.8 mu atm) induced by TCs occurred in postmonsoon (October-December), and large decreases of pCO(2sea) (-14.0 mu atm) occurred in premonsoon (March-May). Large vertical differences in the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to total alkalinity (TA) in the upper layer (Delta DIC/TA) were responsible for increasing pCO(2sea) in postmonsoon. Relatively small values of Delta DIC/TA were responsible for decreasing pCO(2sea) in premonsoon. Five TCs (Hudhud, Five, Kyant, Vardah, and Roanu) were considered. Hudhud significantly enhanced CO2 efflux (18.49 +/- 3.70 mmol CO2/m(2)) in oversaturated areas due to the wind effect during the storm and wind-pump effects after the storm. Vardah insignificantly changed F-CO2 (1.22 +/- 0.24 mmol CO2/m(2)) in undersaturated areas because of the counteraction of these two effects. Roanu significantly enhanced CO2 efflux (19.08 +/- 3.82 mmol CO2/m(2)) in highly oversaturated conditions (Delta pCO(2) > 20 mu atm) since the wind effect greatly exceeded the wind-pump effects.

914805,Assessing carbon dioxide removal through global and regional ocean alkalinization under high and low emission pathways,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels continue to rise, increasing the risk of severe impacts on the Earth system, and on the ecosystem services that it provides. Artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA) is capable of reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations and surface warming and addressing ocean acidification. Here, we simulate global and regional responses to alkalinity (ALK) addition (0.25 PmolALK yr(-1)) over the period 20202100 using the CSIRO-Mk3L-COAL Earth System Model, under high (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5; RCP8.5) and low (RCP2.6) emissions. While regionally there are large changes in alkalinity associated with locations of AOA, globally we see only a very weak dependence on where and when AOA is applied.

549232,Potential climate engineering effectiveness and side effects during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario,"The realization that mitigation efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions have, until now, been relatively ineffective has led to an increasing interest in climate engineering as a possible means of preventing the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change. While many studies have addressed the potential effectiveness of individual methods there have been few attempts to compare them. Here we use an Earth system model to compare the effectiveness and side effects of afforestation, artificial ocean upwelling, ocean iron fertilization, ocean alkalinization and solar radiation management during a high carbon dioxide-emission scenario. We find that even when applied continuously and at scales as large as currently deemed possible, all methods are, individually, either relatively ineffective with limited (<8%) warming reductions, or they have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change.

719212,The carbonate system in the East China Sea in winter,"Measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, total alkalinity (TA), and partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) were conducted at a total of 25 stations along four cross shelf transects in the East China Sea (ECS) in January 2008. Results showed that their distributions in the surface water corresponded well to the general circulation pattern in the ECS. Low DIC and pCO(2) and high pH were found in the warm and saline Kuroshio Current water flowing northeastward along the shelf break, whereas high DIC and pCO(2) and low pH were mainly observed in the cold and less saline China Coastal Current water flowing southward along the coast of Mainland China. Difference between surface water and atmospheric pCO(2) (Delta pCO(2)), ranging from similar to 0 to -111 mu atm, indicated that the entire ECS shelf acted as a CO2 sink during winter with an average flux of CO2 of -13.7 +/- 5.7 (mmol C m(-2) day(-1)), and is consistent with previous studies.

452961,Impact of episodic vertical fluxes on sea surface pCO(2),"Episodic events like hurricanes, storms and frontal-and eddy-driven upwelling can alter the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) at the sea surface by entraining subsurface waters into the surface mixed layer (ML) of the ocean. Since pCO(2) is a function of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), temperature (T), salinity and alkalinity, it responds to the combined impacts of physical, chemical and biological changes. Here, we present an analytical framework for assessing the relative magnitude and sign in the short-term perturbation of surface pCO(2) arising from vertical mixing events. Using global, monthly, climatological datasets, we assess the individual, as well as integrated, contribution of various properties to surface pCO(2) in response to episodic mixing. The response depends on the relative vertical gradients of properties beneath the ML. Many areas of the ocean exhibit very little sensitivity to mixing owing to the compensatory effects of DIC and T on pCO(2), whereas others, such as the eastern upwelling margins, have the potential to generate large positive/negative anomalies in surface pCO(2).

Roger Revelle (Scripps Institution of Oceanography) first articulated the principal need for international and intergovernmental coordination to address global-scale problems such as climate change when IOC was first developed. Regional to global-scale carbon studies started in earnest with the International Decade of Ocean Exploration (I DOE) and Geochemical Ocean Sections Study (GEOSECS) programs in the 1970s, but they were hampered by technological barriers that limited both the precision of carbon system measurements and the greater sampling frequency needed for a comprehensive global view. In 1979, IOC established the Committee on Climate Change and the Ocean (CCCO) with Revelle as Chair. CCCO called for a carbon observation program and sampling strategy that could determine the global oceanic CO, inventory to an accuracy of 10-20 petagrams of carbon (Pg C).

Using a new approach developed by Nicolas Gruber (ETH Zurich) and colleagues with JGOFS-WOCE and other synthesized data sets, one of this article's authors (Sabine) with a host of coauthors estimated that the total accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 between 1800 and 1994 was 118 19 Pg C, just within the uncertainty goals set by JGOFS and IOC prior to the global survey.

As a consequence, most sulfur mines around the world have closed down, large stocks of yellow sulfur have piled up near remote operations, and growing amounts of toxic H2S are disposed of in the subsurface.

We review industrial practices, salient sulfur chemistry, and the geochemical cycle to develop sulfur management concepts at the appropriate scale. We contend that the environmentally responsible disposal of sulfur would involve conversion to sulfuric acid followed by chemical neutralization with equivalent amounts of base. which common alkaline rocks can supply cheaply. The resulting sulfate salts are benign and suitable for brine injection underground or release to the ocean, where they would cause minimal disturbance to ecosystems. Sequestration costs can be recouped by taking advantage of the fuel-grade thermal energy released in the process of oxidizing reduced compounds and sequestering the products.

1285421,Seawater acidification and anthropogenic carbon distribution on the continental shelf and slope of the western South Atlantic Ocean,"Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have led to increases in the flux of CO2 into the oceans. A large fraction of this increased flux occurs due to anthropogenic carbon (C-ant), i.e., the excess carbon released by human activities. The oceans take up large amounts of C-ant, and this process likely affects calcifying organisms and the formation and dissolution of calcium carbonate. In this study, we measured hydrographic and carbonate system parameters in the western South Atlantic Ocean. This region is key for understanding climate issues; however, it remains understudied, especially regarding the drivers of ocean acidification and its effects on marine organisms and ecosystems. Using novel data collected in this undersampled area of the global ocean, we (i) determined values of the marine carbonate system parameters and (ii) characterized the seawater acidification state along the western boundary current off the southeastern and southern coasts of Brazil. Specifically, we measured total alkalinity (A(T)) and pH and applied the TrOCA approach (to derive the C-ant storage in the water masses) in the study area. Our results show that (i) A(T) and the dissolved inorganic carbon distribution in the study region are governed by calcification/dissolution and dilution/evaporation processes and that (ii) C-ant is present in the central and intermediate water masses at an average concentration (+/- method precision) of 75.0 +/- 6.6 mu mol kg(-1) and at depths of up to similar to 1000 m. The highest concentrations are observed in the lower levels of the Tropical Water, although we cannot exclude an overestimated C-ant concentration in this layer, and the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW). These findings suggest that cross-shelf processes likely contribute to increased C-ant along western boundary current systems.

Using the recently available dissociation constants of the purified m-cresol purple (Douglas & Byrne, 2017, ; Muller & Rehder, 2018, ), spectrophotometrically measured pH showed excellent agreement with pH calculated from dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity over a wide salinity range of 0 to 36.9 (0.005 0.016, n = 550). The coupled changes in DIC, oxygen, and nutrients suggest that biological production of organic matter in surface water and the subsequent aerobic respiration in subsurface was the dominant factor regulating pH variability in the nGOM in summer. The highest pH values were observed, together with the maximal biological uptake of DIC and nutrients, at intermediate salinities in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya plumes where light and nutrient conditions were favorable for phytoplankton growth. The lowest pH values (down to 7.59) were observed along with the highest concentrations of DIC and apparent oxygen utilization in hypoxic bottom waters. The nonconservative pH changes in both surface and bottom waters correlated well with the biologically induced changes in DIC, that is, per 100-mu mol/kg biological removal/addition of DIC resulted in 0.21 unit increase/decrease in pH.

Waste fines, representing more than 20% of current US crushed limestone production (> 10(9) tonnes/yr), could provide an inexpensive or free source of AWL carbonate. With limestone transportation then as the dominant cost variable, CO2 mitigation costs of $3-$4/tonne appear to be possible in certain locations. Perhaps 10-20% of US point-source CO2 emissions could be mitigated in this fashion. It is experimentally shown that CO2 sequestration rates of 10(-6) to 10(-5) moles/sec per m(2) of limestone surface area are achievable, with reaction densities on the order of 10(-2) tonnes CO2 m(-3) day(-1), highly dependent on limestone particle size, solution turbulence and flow, and CO2 concentration. Modeling shows that AWL would allow carbon storage in the ocean with significantly reduced impacts to seawater pH relative to direct CO2 disposal into the atmosphere or sea.

18690,Calcium carbonate production response to future ocean warming and acidification,"Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are acidifying the ocean, affecting calcification rates in pelagic organisms, and thereby modifying the oceanic carbon and alkalinity cycles. However, the responses of pelagic calcifying organisms to acidification vary widely between species, contributing uncertainty to predictions of atmospheric CO2 and the resulting climate change. At the same time, ocean warming caused by rising CO2 is expected to drive increased growth rates of all pelagic organisms, including calcifiers. It thus remains unclear whether anthropogenic CO2 emissions will ultimately increase or decrease pelagic calcification rates. Here, we assess the importance of this uncertainty by introducing a dependence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) production on calcite saturation state (Omega(CaCO3)) in an intermediate complexity coupled carbon-climate model. In a series of model simulations, we examine the impact of several variants of this dependence on global ocean carbon cycling between 1800 and 3500 under two different CO2 emissions scenarios. Introducing a calcification-saturation state dependence has a significant effect on the vertical and surface horizontal alkalinity gradients, as well as on the removal of alkalinity from the ocean through CaCO3 burial. These changes result in an additional oceanic uptake of carbon when calcification depends on Omega(CaCO3) (of up to 270 Pg C), compared to the case where calcification does not depend on acidification. In turn, this response causes a reduction of global surface air temperature of up to 0.4 degrees C in year 3500. Different versions of the model produced varying results, and narrowing this range of uncertainty will require better understanding of both temperature and acidification effects on pelagic calcifiers. Nevertheless, our results suggest that alkalinity observations can be used to constrain model results, and may not be consistent with the model versions that simulated stronger responses of CaCO3 production to changing saturation state.",,Article,2012.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,2.0,0.0,18690.0,0 - relevant,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,0,0,0,0,"Calcium carbonate production response to future ocean warming and acidification Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are acidifying the ocean, affecting calcification rates in pelagic organisms, and thereby modifying the oceanic carbon and alkalinity cycles.

376060,Engineering challenges of ocean liming,"The relationship between the level of atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) and the impacts of climate change is uncertain, but a safe concentration may be surpassed this century. Therefore, it is necessary to develop technologies that can accelerate CO2 removal from the atmosphere. This paper explores the engineering challenges of a technology that manipulates the carbonate system in seawater by the addition of calcium oxide powder (CaO; lime), resulting in a net sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into the ocean (ocean liming; OL). Every tonne of CO2 sequestered requires between 1.4 and 1.7 t of limestone to be crushed, calcined, and distributed. Approximately 1 t of CO2 would be created from this activity, of which >80% is a high purity gas (pCO(2) > 98%) amenable to geological storage. It is estimated that the thermal and electrical energy requirements for OL would be 0.6-5.6 and 0.1-1.2 GJ tCO(2)(-1) captured respectively. A preliminary economic assessment suggests that OL could cost approximately US$72-159 t(-1) of CO2. The additional CO2 burden of OL makes it a poor alternative to point source mitigation. However, it may provide a means to mitigate some diffuse emissions and reduce atmospheric concentrations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

143559,Evaluation of reagentless pH modification for in situ ocean analysis: determination of dissolved inorganic carbon using mass spectrometry,"RATIONALE In situ analytical techniques that require the storage and delivery of reagents (e.g., acidic or basic solutions) have inherent durability limitations. The reagentless electrolytic technique for pH modification presented here was developed primarily to ease and to extend the longevity of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) determinations in seawater, but can also be used for other analytical methods. DIC, a primary carbon dioxide (CO2) system variable along with alkalinity, controls seawater pH, carbonate saturation state, and CO2 fugacity. Determinations of these parameters are central to an understanding of ocean acidification and global climate change. METHODS Electrodes fabricated with electroactive materials, including manganese(III) oxide (Mn2O3) and palladium (Pd), were examined for potential use in electrolytic acidification. In-line acidification techniques were evaluated using a bench-top membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) setup to determine the DIC content of artificial seawater. Linear least-squares (LLSQ) calibrations for DIC concentration determinations over a range between 1650 and 2400 mu molkg1 were obtained, using both the novel electrolytic and conventional acid addition techniques. RESULTS At sample rates of 4.5mLmin1, electrodes clad with Mn2O3 and Pd were able to change seawater pH from 7.6 to 2.8 with a power consumption of less than 3W. Although calibration curves were influenced by sampling rates at a flow of 4.5mLmin1, the 1 sigma measurement precision for DIC was of the order of +/- 20 mu molkg1. CONCLUSIONS Calibrations obtained with the novel reagentless technique and the in-line addition of strong acid showed similar capabilities for DIC quantification. However, calculations of power savings for the reagentless technique relative to the mechanical delivery of stored acid demonstrated substantial advantages of the electrolytic technique for long-term deployments (>1year).

836796,Carbonate Chemistry Dynamics of Surface Waters in the Northern Gulf of Mexico,"This paper presents the results of two cruises in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in 2008 that investigated local and short-term factors influencing the carbonate chemistry dynamics and saturation state with respect to aragonite (Omega(aragonite)) of surface seawater in this region. One cruise covered much of the northern half of the Gulf, and the other focused on the coastal zone west of the Atchafalaya Bay outlet of the Mississippi River-the region where the hypoxic ""dead zone"" occurs on the Louisiana shelf. Offshore waters (> 100 m depth) exhibited only small variations in CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)), total alkalinity (TA) and Omega(aragonite). Values were close to those typically observed in subtropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea waters of similar salinity. However, inner shelf waters (< 50 m depth) exhibited large variations in fCO(2), TA, and Omega(aragonite) that were not directly related to salinity or distance from the Mississippi River plume. Changes in TA values were not the result of simple mixing of end-member freshwater and seawater TA concentrations but exhibited a minimum in values near salinity of 25. This minimum could be the result of microbial recycling across salinity gradients, biological removal of alkalinity by formation of calcium carbonate or mixing of a third end-member with a low alkalinity such as Terrebonne Bay. All waters were supersaturated with respect to aragonite. Offshore waters had an average Omega(aragonite) of 3.86 with a standard deviation of only +/- 0.06 and inner shelf waters had a range in Omega(aragonite) values from 3.9 to 9.7 with a median of 4.3. Shelf water Omega(aragonite) values were elevated relative to the offshore as a consequence of both high TA input from Mississippi River and biological drawdown of CO2.

779420,Internal consistency of the inorganic carbon system in the Arctic Ocean,"Highly accurate and precise measurements of the inorganic carbon system are crucial for monitoring and assessing the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean. The Arctic Ocean is an area of particular interest due to Arctic amplification of climate change. Internally consistent constants are essential for making high quality CO2 system measurements and for calculating the full suite of carbon parameters. Temperatures and salinities in the Arctic are near or below the valid ranges of most carbon system constants, but the applicability has never been fully assessed in the Arctic. Using measurements of all four carbon parameters (total alkalinity, total CO2, pH, and pCO(2)) made on the Arctic GEOTRACES/GO-SHIP cruise in summer 2015, we evaluate the internal consistency of six different sets of constants for surface waters at in situ temperature. Five of the six sets of constants are generally internally consistent, but each is statistically significantly different from each other. Although differences among constants are generally within the uncertainty of the calculations, these results indicate caution should be used when comparing data using different constants as biases may result from the choice of constants. We also find significant uncertainty in converting measured pH to pH at in situ temperature. The uncertainty in the pH temperature conversion limits our ability to determine the accuracy of pH measurements, particularly in polar regions.

4937883,Outlook for ammonia as a sustainable transportation fuel,"Recognition of the adverse impacts of climate change has led to interest in a transition to renewable, carbon-neutral energy and fuels. Ammonia has been proposed as a renewable transportation fuel, a medium for local energy storage, and a means for long-distance renewable energy transportation. We provide a perspective on the future use of ammonia as a transportation fuel. Ammonia poses health and safety concerns and ensuring safety for widespread distribution and consumer use would be challenging. Ammonia has a low energy content and is difficult to ignite, making it a relatively poor fuel in internal combustion engines. Engine unburnt ammonia emissions reported in the literature are approximately two to three orders of magnitude greater than Euro IV tailpipe limits and point to severe challenges in meeting emission regulations. Ammonia can be used in solid oxide fuel cells, but these operate at high temperatures (700-800 degrees C) and are not well suited for road vehicles. Proton exchange membrane and direct ammonia alkaline membrane fuel cell systems operate near room temperature and can use ammonia directly or indirectly (after conversion to H-2) however poisoning and durability is problematic. Therefore, the expected use of ammonia as fuel for road transportation is very limited. With its low energy content, ammonia is not a viable aviation fuel. Substantial use of ammonia in rail applications seems unlikely given the advanced state of electrification and challenges associated with ammonia noted for road transport, many of which would also apply to rail. In contrast, the future use of ammonia as fuel in ocean-going ships seems feasible.

However, scientists have a limited understanding of how local currents affect the chemical and thermal relationships between the reef building corals and the surrounding saltwater environment. Coral reefs are known to cause a diel-cycle with dramatic changes in the carbonate system along with oxygen. As calcifying reefs grow, they remove calcium and carbonate ions, reducing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TAlk) and decreasing pH levels. The carbonate ions must be replaced in order for the coral to continue its calcification at a consistent rate. This residence time of surrounding seawater is very difficult to locally quantify in a coral reef as the bathymetry is complex, creating variable currents in all 3 dimensions. Ocean acidification and its negative impact on coral reef health is expected to increase, and fine-scale observations of the link between residence time of surrounding seawater and the dynamic change in water properties remain unknown. A prototype sensor was built with the aim to provide direct measurements of the fine-scale mixing dynamic to collect data from which estimates of mass transfer can be calculated within the reef environment.

3275925,"Affordable CO2 negative emission through hydrogen from biomass, ocean liming, and CO2 storage","A new process to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, by combining commercial industrial technologies with ocean liming and CO2 storage, is presented. The process aims to overcome the limiting factors of other negative emission technologies (cost and energy requirements, potential competition for land and freshwater) while simultaneously addressing the problem of ocean acidification. The overall proposed process is based on the following: (a) a gasifier where the biomass is converted to syngas; (b) a thermal steam reformer working at high temperature where the hydrocarbons and tar oils are converted to hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO); (c) a kiln to produce Ca(OH)(2) (slaked lime) from limestone by using the enthalpy of the hot syngas; (d) the spreading, by means of vessels, of the slaked lime into the seawater to achieve ocean liming; (e) the delivery of syngas to a water gas shift reactor producing CO2 and H-2 that are then separated; (f) the final storage of all CO2 produced in the process; (g) the use of H-2, being the valuable by-product of the whole process, for decarbonized energy production as well as for ammonia synthesis, offsetting part of the production cost, thus generating ""low-cost"" negative emissions. The mass and energy balances show that the total atmospheric CO2 removed by the process is 2.6 ton per ton of biomass used.

The process aims to overcome the limiting factors of other negative emission technologies (cost and energy requirements, potential competition for land and freshwater) while simultaneously addressing the problem of ocean acidification. The overall proposed process is based on the following: (a) a gasifier where the biomass is converted to syngas; (b) a thermal steam reformer working at high temperature where the hydrocarbons and tar oils are converted to hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO); (c) a kiln to produce Ca(OH)(2) (slaked lime) from limestone by using the enthalpy of the hot syngas; (d) the spreading, by means of vessels, of the slaked lime into the seawater to achieve ocean liming; (e) the delivery of syngas to a water gas shift reactor producing CO2 and H-2 that are then separated; (f) the final storage of all CO2 produced in the process; (g) the use of H-2, being the valuable by-product of the whole process, for decarbonized energy production as well as for ammonia synthesis, offsetting part of the production cost, thus generating ""low-cost"" negative emissions. The mass and energy balances show that the total atmospheric CO2 removed by the process is 2.6 ton per ton of biomass used. By adding an estimated 0.43 ton avoided-thanks to the use of produced H-2-the overall CO2 benefit of the process increases to 3.0 ton per ton of biomass.

316553,"Assessing possible consequences of ocean liming on ocean pH, atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated costs","More than 380 Pg of carbon have been released by human activities from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. This carbon release has caused atmospheric CO2 levels to increase by similar to 100 ppmv compared to the highest interglacial value of the last similar to 800,000 years. Net uptake of carbon by the oceans has caused the surface ocean pH to drop by similar to 0.1 pH units. Evaluating carbon sequestration options is now timely. We use the carbon-cycle model LOSCAR to evaluate the effects of artificially enhancing ocean alkalinity from year 2020 to year 2400 on ocean pH and atmospheric pCO(2). Ten different carbon emission scenarios with scaled alkalinity input are simulated. Results show that for ocean pH to be maintained above 8.0, on the order of 2-10 x 10(14) moles of alkalinity/year for C emissions of 1500-5000 Pg C, respectively, is required. Atmospheric pCO(2) remains high (500-600 ppmv) in nine of the carbon emission scenarios.

In comparison with historical data sets, the Changjiang TAlk flux varied around a nearly stable average over the past 55 years. This is much different from some American rivers, where TAlk export fluxes increased for a century long. To assess effects of riverine carbonate inputs on coastal carbonate chemistry, we compared several cases showing freshwater-dilution-induced decline in coastal aragonite saturation state (omega(arag)), including rainwater dilution and riverine water dilution. Without riverine carbonate inputs, the effect of a unit of salinity decrease (due to rainwater dilution) on omega(arag) was expected to be counteracted by a DIC removal of 10 mu mol/kg relative to the baseline value along relevant conservative mixing line, when coastal omega(arag) was close to a critical value of 1.5. Considering terrestrial carbonate inputs from Changjiang, however, the freshwater-dilution-induced coastal omega(arag) suppression decreased by 12%. Our data also showed that more than 10% of wet-season DIC flux discharged from the Changjiang Estuary was sequestered by biological activities in nearshore areas, while the TAlk flux was rarely affected.

Calcitization of the vanished but once laterally-extensive evaporites was apparently driven by bacterial sulphate reduction of solid sulphate in association with organic diagenesis and pyrite precipitation within platform-wide microbialites and sapropels. This counters current interpretations that much of the calcite was precipitated directly on the seafloor or in primary voids in open marine conditions controlled by regional seawater chemistry. Rather, large-scale microbial mediation of ambient waters across a shallow to emergent platform raised carbonate alkalinity and removed kinetic inhibitors to carbonate formation. The low preservation potential of Precambrian solid sulphate is related in part to bacterial sulphate reduction within the microbially-dominated ecosystems of which cyanobacteria were a major component. Evidence for the former presence of solid sulphate in shallow Neoarchaean seas includes pseudomorphs after selenite, also recorded from the contemporaneous Carawine Dolomite of Australia, together with rock fabrics and textures typical of evaporite dissolution.

287799,"Sources and cycling of carbon in continental, serpentinite-hosted alkaline springs in the Voltri Massif, Italy","Active serpentinization systems are abundant on present-day Earth and are of increasing interest because waterrock reactions lead to alkaline, Ca-OH fluids that have the potential to sequester CO2 and form reduced chemical species (e.g. CH4 and H-2) that can support chemolithoautotrophy. We present a study of alkaline (pH 10-12) springs in the Voltri Massif (Italy) that focuses on the sources and cycling of inorganic carbon in the basement rocks, the interacting fluids, and the resulting surface carbonate deposits. Most springs are located in mantle rocks that underwent varying degrees of ocean-floor serpentinization and incorporation of carbon (as carbonate and organic carbon) in the Jurassic, which is preserved during subsequent subduction and uplift onto the continent. The springs are fed by meteoric water that evolves into alkaline, Ca-rich spring waters that have 2-3 times higher Ca concentrations than the adjacent rivers. Our study is consistent with previous reaction path modeling and identifies the formation of clay minerals in serpentinites that have been altered by alkaline fluids. These strongly altered basement rocks contain up to 2 wt.% C in the shallow subsurface, also documented by the presence of late calcite veins. Concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of the alkaline fluids are generally low (<16 mu mol/L) and delta C-13(DIC) is between -24.2% and + 1.37.0. We argue that the concentrations and isotopic composition of the DIC in the alkaline waters provide evidence for 1) the precipitation of calcium carbonate under closed-system conditions with respect to atmospheric CO2 and 2) removal of DIC by microbial activity in the subsurface. Late-stage uptake of atmospheric CO2 in the shallow subsurface or at the exit sites subsequent to water-rock-microbe interactions in the basement result in fluids with lower pH and Ca, and enrichment in DIC and C-13. At the surface, interaction of the high pH, Ca-OH fluids with atmospheric CO2 causes precipitation of carbonates as travertines or crusts on the basement rocks, storing CO2 as calcium carbonate. Carbonate precipitation at the exit sites is strongly dominated by kinetic processes leading to carbon and oxygen isotope compositions as low as 27.2 parts per thousand and 18.7 parts per thousand, respectively. With increasing distance from the springs, the C-13 and 190 content of the carbonate increases and the fluid pH changes towards neutral. Our study shows that surficial carbonate precipitation plays a subordinate role in carbon sequestration, but that the evolution from Mg-HCO3 spring waters to Ca-OH waters removes significant amounts of carbon, presumably in the subsurface. We calculate that the serpentinites have the capacity to sequester up to 0.50 to 2.05 x 10(9) mol carbon per year and conclude that they can take up significantly more CO2 than they currently contain.

We quantify the biogeochemical impacts by using atmosphere and ocean models.

The decrease in surface alkalinity drives a net air-sea efflux Of CO2, reducing surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); the alkalinity and DIC changes mostly offset each other, and the decline in surface pH is small. Additional impacts arise from nitrogen fertilization, leading to elevated primary production and biological DIC drawdown that reverses in some places the sign of the surface pH and air-sea CO2 flux perturbations.

Thus, above-ground CO2 hydration and mineral carbonate scrubbing may provide a relatively simple point-source CO2 capture and storage scheme at coastal locations. Such low-tech CO2 mitigation could be especially relevant for retrofitting to existing power plants and for deployment in the developing world, the primary source of future CO2 emissions. Addition of the resulting alkaline solution to the ocean may benefit marine ecosystems that are currently threatened by acidification, while also allowing the utilization of the vast potential of the sea to safely sequester anthropogenic carbon. This approach in essence hastens Nature's own very effective but slow CO2 mitigation process; carbonate mineral weathering is a major consumer of excess atmospheric CO2 and ocean acidity on geologic times scales.",,Article,2011.0,1.0,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,1.0,293897.0,0 - relevant,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,0,relevant,1,1,1,1,"CO2 Mitigation via Capture and Chemical Conversion in Seawater A lab-scale seawater/mineral carbonate gas scrubber was found to remove up to 97% of CO2 in a simulated flue gas stream at ambient temperature and pressure, with a large fraction of this carbon ultimately converted to dissolved calcium bicarbonate.
