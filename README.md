# Repository Overview

This repository accompanies the publication *"Scientific literature on carbon dioxide removal revealed as much larger through AI-enhanced systematic mapping"*, available [here](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4109712/v1).  
The processed data can be explored and downloaded from [climateliterature.org](https://climateliterature.org/#/project/cdrmap).

## Repository Structure

- **Training Models**  
  The [training](https://github.com/mcc-apsis/cdr-map/tree/main/training) folder contains the code used to train and test the classification models that categorize the literature in the systematic map.

- **Model Evaluation**  
  The [check_models](https://github.com/mcc-apsis/cdr-map/tree/main/check_models) folder includes scripts to evaluate model performance, generate evaluation metrics, and calculate confidence intervals.

- **Figure Generation**  
  The [analysis_plots](https://github.com/mcc-apsis/cdr-map/tree/main/analysis_plots) folder provides the code used to create all figures published in the paper.

## Notes

All code is written in Python and organized for reproducibility. Detailed instructions for training the models can be found in the README file within the respective subfolder.
